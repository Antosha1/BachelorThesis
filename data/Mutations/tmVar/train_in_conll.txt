have O
been O
identified O
in O

This O

investigated O
the O
genetic O
and O

in O

from O
30 O
Korean O
patients O

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL O
FINDINGS: O
NF2 O
gene O
mutations O
were O
detected O
using O
PCR O
and O
direct O
DNA O
sequencing O
and O
three O
highly O
polymorphic O
microsatellite O
DNA O
markers O
were O
used O
to O
assess O
the O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
(LOH) O
from O
chromosome O
22. O
Aberrant O
hypermethylation O
of O
the O
CpG O
island O
of O
the O
NF2 O
gene O
was O
also O
analyzed. O
The O
tumor O
size, O
the O
clinical O
growth O
index, O
and O
the O
proliferative O
activity O
assessed O
using O
the O
Ki-67 O
labeling O
index O
were O
evaluated. O
We O
found O
18 O
mutations O
in O
16 O
cases O
of O
30 O
schwannomas O
(53%). O
The O
mutations O
included O
eight O
frameshift O
mutations, O
seven O
nonsense O
mutations, O
one O
in-frame O
deletion, O
one O
splicing O
donor O
site, O
and O
one O
missense O
mutation. O
Nine O
patients O
(30%) O
showed O
allelic O
loss. O
No O
patient O
had O
aberrant O
hypermethylation O
of O
the O
NF2 O
gene O
and O
correlation O
between O
NF2 O
genetic O
alterations O
and O
tumor O
behavior O
was O
not O
observed O
in O
this O
study. O
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: O
The O
molecular O
genetic O
changes O
in O
sporadic O
VS O
identified O
here O
included O
mutations O
and O
allelic O
loss, O
but O
no O
aberrant O
hypermethylation O
of O
the O
NF2 O
gene O
was O
detected. O
In O
addition, O
no O
clear O
genotype/phenotype O
correlation O
was O
identified. O
Therefore, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
other O
factors O
contribute O
to O
tumor O
formation O
and O
growth. O

We O
identified O
61 O
different O

BACKGROUND: O
Signalling O

Here O
we O
describe O
a O

CASE O
PRESENTATION: O
We O
present O
a O

whom O
routine O

had O
excluded O
the O
FGFR2 O

The O

found O
to O

a O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Based O
on O
the O

the O

increases O
the O

In O
an O

we O
showed O
that O

was O
expressed O
in O
almost O
all O

of O
seven O

lines, O
including O
two O

(A549 O

Here, O
we O
show O
that O
C10ORF97 O
is O
downregulated O
in O
non-small-cell O
lung O
cancer O
(NSCLC) O

compared O
with O

These O

Together, O
these O

We O

Furthermore, O
we O
identified O
a O
650-kbp O

which O
included O
the O
C1-INH O

We O
evaluated O
the O

The O
levels O

were O
high O
during O
the O
angio-oedema O
attacks, O
and O
often O
exceeded O
the O
normal O

thus O
the O

PURPOSE: O
Aniridia O
(AN) O
is O
a O
rare O
congenital O
panocular O
disorder O
caused O
by O
the O
mutations O
of O
the O
paired O
box O
homeotic O
gene O
6(PAX6) O
gene. O
The O
PAX6gene O
is O
also O
involved O
in O
other O
anterior O
segment O
malformations O
including O
Peters O
anomaly. O
We O
studied O
the O
PAX6gene O
mutations O
in O
a O
cohort O
of O
affected O
individuals O
with O
different O
clinical O
phenotype O
including O
AN, O
coloboma O
of O

malformations. O
PATIENTS O
AND O
METHODS: O
Six O
unrelated O
families O
and O
10 O
sporadic O
patients O
were O
examined O
clinically. O
After O
informed O
consent O
was O
obtained, O
genomic O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
the O
venous O
blood O
of O
all O
participants. O
Mutation O
screening O
of O
all O
exons O
of O
the O
PAX6gene O
was O
performed O
by O
direct O
sequencing O
of O
PCR-amplified O
DNA O
fragments. O
Multiplex O
ligation-dependent O
probe O
amplification O
(MLPA) O
was O
performed O
to O
detect O
large O
deletions. O
RESULTS: O
By O
clinical O
examination, O
the O
patients O
and O
the O
pedigrees O
were O
divided O
into O
the O
following O
three O
groups: O
AN, O
coloboma O
of O
iris O
and O
choroids, O
and O
the O
anterior O
segment O
malformations O
including O
peters O
anomaly. O
Sequencing O
of O
the O
PAX6gene, O
three O
intragenic O
mutations O
including O
a O
novel O
heterozygous O
splicing-site O
mutations O
c.357-3C>G B-MUT
(p.Ser119fsX) O
were O
identified O
in O
the O
patients O
of O
the O
AN O
group. O
A O
novel O
missense O
mutation O
c.643T>C B-MUT
(p.S216P) O
was O
detected O
in O
the O
anterior O
segment O
malformation O
group. O
The O
mutation O
p.S216P B-MUT
located O
in O
the O
homeodomain O
region O
of O
the O
PAX6 O
caused O
the O
phenotype O
of O
Peters O
anomaly O
in O
family O
A6 O
with O
different O

Through O
MLPA O
analysis, O
a O
large O
deletion O
including O
the O
whole O
PAX6gene O
and O
DKFZ O
p686k1684gene O
was O
detected O
in O
one O
sporadic O
patient O
from O
the O
AN O
group. O
Neither O
intragenic O
mutation O
nor O
large O
deletion O
was O
identified O
in O
the O
group O
with O
coloboma O
of O
iris O
and O
choroid. O
CONCLUSION: O
Our O
findings O
further O
confirmed O
that O
different O
kind O
of O
mutations O
might O
cause O
different O
ocular O
phenotype, O
and O
clearly O
clinical O

ARX O
mutations O
cause O
a O
diverse O
spectrum O
of O
human O
disorders, O
ranging O
from O
severe O
brain O

(ID). O
ARX O
is O
a O

that O
include O
four O
polyalanine O
(pA) O

the O
first O
two O
of O
which O
are O
frequently O

We O
progressively O
screened O

Overall, O
eight O

(0.82%) O
with O
three O

(0.6%), O
including O
one O

(c.1074G>T). O
Four O
ultraconserved O

ARX O
(uc466-469) O
were O
also O
screened O
in I-MUT
a O

94 O
patients, O
with O
three O
unique O

The O
subcellular O

was O
assessed O
for O
11 O

Protein O
mislocalization O
increased O
as O

and O
phenotypic O
severity, O
as O
has O
been O
previously O
suggested O
for O
pA1. O
Similarly, O
protein O
mislocalization O
of O
the O
homeodomain O

also O
correlated O
with O

suggesting O
an O

genotype O
and O
higher O
virulence O
of O
a O
strain O
of O
Sporothrix O
schenckii O
causing O
disseminated O
cutaneous O
sporotrichosis. O
Sporotrichosis O
is O
usually O
a O
localized, O
lymphocutaneous O
disease, O
but O
its O
disseminated O
type O
was O
rarely O
reported. O
The O
main O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
identify O
specific O
DNA O
sequence O
variation O
and O
virulence O
of O
a O
strain O
of O
Sporothrix O
schenckii O
isolated O
from O
the O

sporotrichosis. O
We O
confirmed O
this O
strain O
to O
be O
S. O

gene O
sequence O
analysis O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
routine O
mycological O

We O
found O
a O
10-bp O
deletion O
in O
the O
ribosomal O
NTS O
region O
of O
this O
strain, O
in O
reference O
to O
the O
sequence O
of O
control O
strains O
isolated O
from O
fixed O
cutaneous O
sporotrichosis. O
After O
inoculated O
into O
immunosuppressed O
mice, O
this O
strain O
caused O
more O
extensive O
system O
involvement O
and O
showed O
stronger O
virulence O
than O
the O
control O
strain O
isolated O
from O
a O
fixed O
cutaneous O
sporotrichosis. O
Our O
study O
thus O
suggests O
that O
different O
clinical O
manifestation O
of O
sporotrichosis O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
variation O
in O
genotype O
and O
virulence O
of O
the O
strain, O
independent O
of O
effects O
due O
to O
the O
immune O

PURPOSE: O
To O
identify O
the O
mutation O
in O
the O
fibrillin-1 O
gene O
(FBN1) O
in O
a O
Chinese O
family O
with O
Marfan O
syndrome O
(MFS). O
METHODS: O
Patients O
and O
family O
members O
were O
given O
complete O
physical, O
ophthalmic, O
and O
cardiovascular O
examinations. O
Genomic O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
leukocytes O
of O
venous O
blood O
of O
six O
individuals O
in O
the O
family O
and O
170 O
healthy O
Chinese O
individuals. O
All O
of O
the O
65 O
coding O
exons O
and O
their O
flanking O
intronic O
boundaries O
of O
FBN1 O
were O
amplified O
in O
the O
proband O
by O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
and O
followed O
by O
direct O
sequencing. O
The O
mutation O
identified O
in O
the O
proband O
was O
screened O
in O
the O
other O
family O
members O
and O
the O
170 O
healthy O
Chinese O
individuals O
by O
direct O
sequencing. O
Protein O
conservation O
analysis O
was O
performed O
in O
six O
species O
using O
an O
online O
ClustalW O
tool. O
Protein O
structure O
was O
modeled O
based O
on O
the O
Protein O
data O
bank O
and O
mutated O
in O
DeepView O
v4.0.1 O
to O
predict O
the O
functional O
consequences O
of O
the O
mutation. O
RESULTS: O
A O
novel O
heterozygous O
c.3703T>C B-MUT
change O
in O
exon O
29 O
of O
FBN1 O
was O
detected O
in O
the O
proband, O
which O
resulted O
in O
the O
substitution O
of O
serine O
by O
proline O
at O
codon O
1235 I-MUT
(p.S1235P). O
This O
mutation O
was O
also O
present O
in O
two O
family O
members O
but O
absent O
in O
the O
other, O
unaffected O
family O
members O
and O
the O
170 O
healthy O
Chinese O
individuals. O
The O
mutant O
residue O
located O
in O
the O
calcium O
binding O
epidermal O
growth O
factor-like#15 O
domain O
is O
highly O
conserved O
among O
mammalian O
species O
and O
could O
probably O
induce O
conformation O
change O
of O
the O
domain. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
We O
indentified O
a O
novel O
p.S1235P B-MUT
mutation O
in O
FBN1, O
which O
is O
the O
causative O
mutation O
for O
MFS O
in O
this O
family. O
Our O
result O
expands O
the O
mutation O
spectrum O
of O
FBN1 O
and O
contributes O
to O
the O
study O
of O
the O

(n=6) O
(p=0.002). O
TRPV1 O
is O
a O
sensory O

located O
on O
chromosome O
17p13, O
adjacent O
to O
CARKL/SHPK. O
It O
was O

together O
with O
a(1)-microglobulin O
from O
the O

was O
to O
investigate O
the O
possible O

MATERIAL O
AND O
METHODS: O
To O
analyse O
the O
DNA, O
blood O
samples O
were O
taken O
from O
75 O
kidney O
stone O
formers O
who O
had O
a O
familial O
stone O
history, O
35 O
sporadic O
stone O
formers O
and O
101 O
healthy O
individuals. O
Four O
exons O
of O
bikunin O
gene O
and O
five O
parts O
of O
the O

region O
of O
the O
AMBP O
gene O
were O
screened O
using O
single-strand O

sequence O
analysis. O
RESULTS: O
The O
Init-2 O
region O
of O
the O
promoter O
of O
AMBP O
gene O
had O
polymorphisms O
at O
positions O
-218 I-MUT

nt O
giving O
three O

with O
frequencies O
of O
17.06%, O
60.19% O
and O
22.75%, O
respectively, O
in O
all O
groups. O
Therefore, O
the O
Init-2 O
region O
appears O
to O
be O
polymorphic. O
As O
a O
result, O
the O
1,3 O
allele O
has O
-218G O
and O
-189T O
complying O
with O
the O
reference O
database O
sequence, O
the O
2,4 O
allele O
has O
-218G O
and O
T-189C B-MUT

and O
the O
allele O
1,2,3,4 O
genotype O
has O
substitutions O
at O
positions O
G-218C B-MUT
and O
T-189C. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
There O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
allele O
distribution O
between O
patients O
and O

These O
results O
are O
the O
first O
to O

Although O
the O
Init-2 O
region O
of O
the O
AMBP O
gene O
is O
the O

(AVSDs) O
occur O
as O
clinical O
defects O
of O
several O

Consequently, O
there O

METHODS: O
This O
study O
included O
133 O

RESULTS: O
In O
a O
patient, O
a O
C-to-G O
transition O
was O
identified O
at O
nucleotide O
857 O
in O

This O
patient O
had O
an O

was O
detected O
in O
a O

were O
identified O
in O
the O
calcium-binding O
EGF O

an O
unusual O
deletion O
mutation O
of O
the O
GALT O
gene O
in O
the O
Ashkenazi O
population. O
Classic O
galactosemia O
is O
an O
autosomal O
recessive O
disorder O
of O
galactose O
metabolism O
manifesting O
in O
the O
first O
weeks O
of O
life O
following O
exposure O
to O
a O
milk-based O
diet. O
Despite O
the O
benefit O
of O
avoidance O
of O
lactose, O
many O
patients O
suffer O
from O
long-term O
complications O
including O
neurological O
deficits O
and O

failure. O
To O
date, O
over O
230 O
mutations O
have O
been O
described O
in O
the O
GALT O
gene O
resulting O
in O
galactosemia. O
Recently, O
an O
unusual O
mutation O
was O
characterized O
causing O
a O
5.5 O
kb O
deletion, O
with O
a O
relatively O
high O
carrier O
rate O
in O
subjects O
of O
Ashkenazi O
Jewish O
(AJ) O
descent. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
estimate O
the O
carrier O
frequency O
of O
this O
mutation O
in O
the O
AJ O
population O
in O
Israel. O
For O
this O
purpose O
we O
developed O
a O
high-throughput O
methodology O
to O
genotype O
both O
normal O
and O
deleted O
alleles O
using O
a O
chip-based O
matrix-assisted O
laser O
desorption-time-of-flight O
(MALDI-TOF) O
mass O
spectrometer O
and O
Multiplex O
PCR. O
DNA O
samples O
of O
760 O
anonymous O
AJ O
subjects O
were O
submitted O
for O
analysis, O
subsequently O
detecting O
six O
individuals O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
GALT O
deletion O
mutation, O
giving O
a O
carrier O
frequency O
of O
1 O
in O
127 O
(0.79%). O
Based O
on O
these O
results, O
we O
suggest O
that O
the O
method O
described O
here O
provides O
a O
basis O
for O
genetic O
screening O
and O
prenatal O
counseling O
and O
can O
potentially O
reduce O
the O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
associated O
with O
delayed O
diagnosis O
of O
galactosemia O
in O
this O
patient O
population. O

Large O

are O
found O
in O
approximately O
5% O
of O
patients O
with O
severe O

A, O
but O
only O
a O
few O
deletion O

have O
been O
characterised O
precisely O

In O
this O
study O
we O
characterised O
the O
deletion O
breakpoints O
of O
two O
patients O
with O
severe O
haemophilia O
A, O
large O
deletions O
and O
factor O
VIII O
(FVIII) O
inhibitors, O
and O
subsequently O
established O
deletion-specific O
assays O
for O
the O
identification O
of O

Patient O
1 O
had O
a O
deletion O
of O
37,410 O
bp O
comprising O
exon O
1 O
and O
the O
F8 O
promoter O
region, O
and O
a O
5 O
bp O

(GGGCC) O
is O
present O
at O
the O

In O
patient O
2, O
a O
deletion O
of O
22,230 O
bp O
including O
parts O
of O
intron O
25, O
exon O
26 O
and O
3'-UTR O
was O
identified. O
No O
homologous O
repetitive O
elements O
were O
found O
at O
the O
breakpoints. O
However, O
both O
breakpoints O
were O
located O
within O
long O
terminal O
repeats O
of O
endogenous O
retroviruses O
and O
the O
DNA O
motif O
TTTAAA O
- O
known O
to O
be O
able O
to O
bend O
DNA O

- O
was O
identified O
at O
the O
centromeric O
breakpoint. O
By O
deletion-specific O
PCR O
experiments O
we O
were O
able O
to O
identify O
a O
heterozygous O
state O
in O
mother O
2 O
(carrier) O
while O
mother O
1 O
presented O
only O
with O
wild-type O
alleles O
(non-carrier). O
Both O
deletions O
are O
most O
likely O
created O
by O
DNA O
double O

breaks O
and O
subsequent O
DNA O
repair O
by O
the O
non-homologous O

joining O
DNA O

pathway O
(NHEJ). O
The O
exact O
identification O
of O
the O

provides O
a O
reliable O
diagnostic O
tool O
for O

OBJECTIVE: O
C-C O

A O
32 O

in O
the O

We O
investigated O
whether O
the O

in O
a O

for O
the O

Differences O

Association O

was O
analyzed. O
RESULTS: O
Genotype O
frequencies O
of O
each O

were O
in O
Hardy-Weinberg O

The O
genotype O
frequencies O
of O
patients O
did O
not O
differ O
significantly O
from O

(CCR5//\32, O

However, O
there O

CONCLUSION: O
Although O
an O

cannot O
be O
excluded, O
the O
CCR5 O

deletion O
does O
not O
seem O

In O

BACKGROUND: O
Mice O

in O
the O
Klotho O

exhibit O
multiple O

including O
arteriosclerosis. O
We O
hypothesised O
that O
the O
G-395A B-MUT

METHODS: O
We O
investigate O
whether O
the O
G-395A B-MUT

EH O
in O
a O
population O
consisting O
of O
215 O

We O
also O
tested O
whether O
a O

RESULTS: O
Differences O

the O
G-395A B-MUT

(P=0.032). O
There O
are O

A I-MUT

(P=0.024) O
after O

The O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
G-395A B-MUT

of O

Functional O

We O

no O

Thus, O
homozygosity O
for O
the O

would O
result O
in O

This O

IRF4 O

We O
propose O

BACKGROUND: O
Spondyloepiphyseal O

characterized O
by O
a O

The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
is O
to O
describe O
a O
large O
Chinese O
SEDT O
family O
with O
a O

and O
describe O
the O

METHODS: O
Eight O
affected O
males O
of O
the O
family O
were O
diagnosed O
with O
SEDT O
according O
to O
their O
clinical O
and O

Direct O
DNA O

performed. O
RT-PCR O

performed O
to O

A I-MUT
short O
summary O
of O
all O

RESULTS: O
DNA O

revealed O
that O
all O
the O

carried O
an O

(c.370-371insA) O
unreported O
previously, O

The O

also O
observed O
in I-MUT
a O
10-year O

Eight O

Identification O
of O
the O
novel O

also O
the O

We O
report O
a O
69-year-old O
woman O
who O
presented O
with O
dyspnea, O

She O
also O

Her O

were O
alleviated O
by O

although O
there O
was O
high-serum O

Investigations O
for O
any O
possible O
etiologies O
of O

were O
all O
negative. O
An O
X-linked O

was O
highly O
suspicious O
in O
view O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
of O

and O
died O
of O
respiratory O

at O
the O
ages O
of O
22 O

29, O
respectively. O
Her O
muscle O
biopsy O
showed O
mosaic O
pattern O
with O
dystrophin O
antibody O
against O
amino-terminal, O
carboxy-terminal, O

Her O

revealed O
heterozygous O

of O
the O

Therefore, O

BACKGROUND: O
Dystrophic O

OBJECTIVES: O
To O

METHODS: O
To O
determine O
the O

of O
the O
disease, O
we O
performed O
COL7A1 O
mutation O

reverse O

and O
real-time O

The O

RESULTS: O
We O

Even O
though O
the O
frequency O

no O

Also, O
no O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Taken O
together, O
the O

We O

The O

that O
the O

These O
data O
indicate O
that O
mutations O

MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
We O
have O
examined O
33 O
samples O
of O
MCL O
(28 O
primary O
MCL O
and O
5 O

were O
confirmed O
by O
SNP O
arrays, O
including O
deletion O
of O
INK4A/ARF, O
duplication/amplification O
of O
MYC, O

We O
also O
identified O
a O
duplication/amplification O
that O
occurred O
at O
13q O
involving O
oncogenic O

including O
duplication/amplification O
of O
cyclin O
D1, O
del(1p), O
del(6q), O
dup(3q) O
and O

allowing O
us O
to O
narrow O
the O
size O
of O
the O
commonly O

is O
a O
frequent O
cause O
of O
mitochondrial O
DNA O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
describe O
a O
new O

mutation O
in O
the O
DGUOK O
gene O
and O
the O
clinical, O
radiologic, O

of O
these O
DGUOK O
patients. O
This O
new O
DGUOK O
homozygous O
mutation O
(c.444-62C>A) O
was O
identified O
in O
three O
patients O
from O
two O

Interestingly, O
we O
found O
subtentorial O

This O
new O

of O
the O
putative O
impact O
of O
the O

rendering O
the O

In O
addition, O
a O
common O
haplotype O
that O
segregated O

which O
span O
4.6 O

In O
conclusion, O
we O
report O
a O

(EM) O
separately. O
Genomic O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
peripheral O
blood O
of O
11 O
family O

CHST6 O
was O
amplified O
by O
the O

(PCR) O
method. O
The O
PCR O

RESULTS: O
The O
positive O

The O
compound O
heterozygous O
mutations, O
c.892C>T B-MUT
and O
c.1072T>C, O
were O
identified O
in O
exon O
3 I-MUT
of O
CHST6 O
in O

(p.Y358H). O
The O
six O

carried O
alternative O
heterozygous O
mutations. O
These O
two O
mutations O
were O
not O
detected O
in O
any O
of O
the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Those O
novel O
compound O
heterozygous O
mutations O
were O
thought O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
loss O
of O

BACKGROUND: O
Oculopharyngeal O
muscular O

(OPMD) O
is O
a O

OPMD O

We O
identified O
and O

a O
PABPN1 O

in O
a O
Taiwanese O

with O
OPMD. O
METHODS: O
The O
phenotypic O

characteristics O
of O
all O
subjects O
were O
evaluated O
in O
a O
Taiwanese O
OPMD O

Genetic O

using O

RESULTS: O
Ten O
subjects O
with O
OPMD O
(6 O

and O
4 O
asymptomatic) O
within O
the O
Taiwanese O
family O
carried O
a O
novel O
mutation O
in O
the O
PABPN1 O
gene. O
The O
normal O
(GCG)6(GCA)3GCG O
sequence O
was O
replaced O
by O
(GCG)6(GCA)(GCG)4(GCA)3GCG O
due O
to O
an O
insertion O
of O
(GCG)4GCA O
into O
the O
normal O
allele O
in O
the O
Taiwanese O
OPMD O
subjects. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
In O
contrast O
to O
a O
single O
GCG O
expansion O
in O
most O
of O
OPMD O
patients O
in O
the O
literature, O
an O
insertion O
of O
(GCG)4GCA O
in O
the O
PABPN1 O
gene O
was O
found O
in O
the O
Taiwanese O
OPMD O
subjects. O
The O
identification O
of O
this O

Genome-wide O

carcinomas. O
PURPOSE: O
The O
importance O
of O
the O
BRCA O
gene O
products O
in O
maintaining O
genomic O
stability O
led O
us O
to O
hypothesize O
that O
BRCA-associated O
and O
sporadic O
ovarian O
cancers O
would O
have O
distinctive O
genetic O
profiles O
despite O
similarities O
in O
histologic O
appearance. O
EXPERIMENTAL O
DESIGN: O
A O
whole-genome O
copy O

analysis O
of O
fresh, O
frozen, O
papillary O
serous O
ovarian O
cancer O
DNA O
was O
done O
using O

Mapping O
Array O
using O
each O

DNA O
as O
the O

control. O
Loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
and O
copy O
number O
abnormalities O
were O
summarized O
to O
define O
regions O
of O
amplification, O
deletion, O
or O
uniparental O
disomy O
(UPD), O
defined O
as O
loss O
of O
one O
allele O
and O
duplication O
of O
the O
remaining O
allele. O
Genomic O
abnormalities O
were O
compared O
between O
BRCA-associated O
and O
sporadic O
tumors. O
RESULTS: O
We O
compared O
6 O
BRCA-associated O
with O
14 O
sporadic O
papillary O
serous O
ovarian O
carcinomas. O
Genetic O
instability, O
measured O
by O
percentage O

altered, O
was O
more O
pronounced O
in O
BRCA-associated O
tumors O
(median, O
86.6%; O

54-100%) O
than O
sporadic O
tumors O
(median, O
43.6%; O

2-83%; O
P O

0.009). O
We O
used O

plots O
to O
show O
the O
proportion O
of O
cases O
affected O
by O
each O
type O
abnormality O
at O
each O
genomic O
region. O
BRCA-associated O
tumors O
showed O
genome-wide O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
primarily O
due O
to O
the O
occurrence O
of O
UPD O
rather O
than O
deletion. O
UPD O
was O
found O
in O
100% O
of O
the O
BRCA-associated O
and O
50% O
of O
the O
sporadic O
tumors O
profiled. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
study O
reports O
on O
a O
previously O
underappreciated O
genetic O
phenomenon O
of O
UPD, O
which O
occurs O
frequently O
in O
ovarian O
cancer O
DNA. O
We O
observed O
distinct O
genetic O
patterns O
between O
BRCA-associated O
and O
sporadic O
ovarian O
cancers, O
suggesting O
that O
these O
papillary O
serous O
tumors O
arise O
from O
different O
molecular O
pathways. O

Mutations O
in O
phospholipase O
C O
epsilon O
1 O
are O
not O
sufficient O
to O
cause O
diffuse O
mesangial O
sclerosis. O
Diffuse O
mesangial O
sclerosis O
occurs O
as O
an O
isolated O
abnormality O
or O
as O
a O
part O
of O
a O
syndrome. O
Recently, O
mutations O
in O
phospholipase O
C O
epsilon O
1 O
(PLCE1) O
were O
found O
to O
cause O
a O
nonsyndromic, O
autosomal O
recessive O
form O
of O
this O
disease. O
Here O
we O
describe O
three O
children O
from O
one O
consanguineous O
kindred O
of O
Pakistani O
origin O
with O
diffuse O
mesangial O
sclerosis O
who O
presented O
with O
congenital O
or O
infantile O
nephrotic O
syndrome. O
Homozygous O
mutations O
in O
PLCE1 O
(also O
known O
as O
KIAA1516, O
PLCE, O
or O
NPHS3) O
were O
identified O
following O
genome-wide O
mapping O
of O
single-nucleotide O
polymorphisms. O
All O
affected O
children O
were O
homozygous O
for O
a O
four-basepair O
deletion O
in O
exon O
3, O
which O
created O
a O
premature O
translational O
stop O
codon. O
Analysis O
of O
the O
asymptomatic O
father O
of O
two O
of O
the O
children O
revealed O
that O
he O
was O
also O
homozygous O
for O
the O
same O
mutation. O
We O
conclude O
this O
nonpenetrance O
may O
be O
due O
to O
compensatory O
mutations O
at O
a O
second O
locus O
and O
that O
mutation O
within O
PLCE1 O
is O
not O
always O
sufficient O
to O
cause O
diffuse O
mesangial O
sclerosis. O

Somatic O
TP53 O
mutation O
mosaicism O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
Li-Fraumeni O
syndrome. O
We O
present O
a O
girl O
who O
developed O
adrenocortical O
adenoma O
at O
the O
age O
of O
1 O
year O
and O
osteosarcoma O
at O
the O
age O
of O
5 O
years. O
There O
was O
no O
history O
of O
cancer O
in O
her O
parents O
and O
their O
relatives. O
However, O
both O
tumors O
were O
typical O
for O
the O
Li-Fraumeni O
syndrome O
(LFS), O
and O
the O
patient O
met O
criteria O
for O
germline O
TP53 O
mutation O
testing. O
A B-MUT
mutation O
in O
codon O
282 I-MUT
(Arg282Trp) O
was O
identified O
in O
her O
blood O
lymphocyte O
genomic O
DNA. O
The O
substitution O
was O
found O
in O
neither O
of O
her O
parents, O
which O
indicated O
a O
possibility O
of O
a O
de O
novo O
mutation. O
Unexpectedly, O
sequencing O
of O
the O
DNA O
of O
the O
patient O
repeatedly O
showed O
allelic O
imbalance O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
normal O
allele. O
This O
observation O
prompted O
us O
to O
investigate O
the O
putative O
somatic O
mosaicism O
in O
the O
patient O
consisting O
of O
normal O
cells O
and O
cells O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
mutation. O
The O
imbalance O
was O
also O
examined O
in O
two O
other O
non-invasively O
sampled O
tissues, O
buccal O
cells, O
and O
cells O
from O
the O
urine O
sediment, O
and O
sequencing O
was O
confirmed O
with O
two O
other O
independent O
methods. O
While O
the O
findings O
in O
blood O
and O
the O
urine O
sediment O
were O
similar, O
in O
buccal O
cells O
both O
alleles O
were O
present O
in O
equal O
amounts. O
The O
allele O
ratio O
in O
lymphocytes O
was O
consistent O
with O
a O
mosaic O
where O
about O
2/3 O
of O
cells O
carried O
two O
normal O
alleles O
and O
only O
1/3 O
was O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
mutation. O
Despite O
the O
mosaicism O
the O
girl O
developed O
two O
early O
childhood O
tumors O
of O
mesodermal O
origin, O
and O
her O
phenotype O
was O
thus O
not O
milder O
than O
that O
of O
other O
germline O
TP53 O
mutation O
carriers. O
To O
our O
knowledge O
this O
is O
the O
first O
description O
of O
somatic O
mosaicism O
for O
a O
de O

TP53 O
mutation O
in O
LFS. O

A O
comprehensive O
analysis O
of O
the O
CDKN2A O

in O

reveals O
genomic O
deletion, O
copy O
number O
neutral O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity, O
and O

with O
specific O

subgroups. O
Inactivation O
of O
the O
tumor O
suppressor O
gene, O
CDKN2A, O
can O
occur O
by O
deletion, O

or O
mutation. O
We O
assessed O
the O
principal O
mode O
of O
inactivation O
in O
childhood O
acute O
lymphoblastic O
leukemia O
(ALL) O
and O
frequency O
in O
biologically O
relevant O
subgroups. O
Mutation O
or O
methylation O
was O
rare, O
whereas O
genomic O
deletion O
occurred O
in O
21% O
of O
B-cell O
precursor O
ALL O
and O
50% O
of O
T-ALL O
patients. O
Single O

revealed O
copy O
number O
neutral O
(CNN) O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
(LOH) O
in O
8% O
of O
patients. O
Array-based O
comparative O
genomic O
hybridization O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
mean O
size O
of O
deletions O
was O
14.8 O
Mb O
and O
biallelic O
deletions O
composed O
a O
large O
and O
small O
deletion O
(mean O
sizes, O
23.3 O
Mb O
and O
1.4 O
Mb). O
Among O
86 O
patients, O
only O
2 O
small O
deletions O
were O
below O
the O
resolution O
of O
detection O
by O
fluorescence O
in O

hybridization. O
Patients O
with O
high O
hyperdiploidy, O
ETV6-RUNX1, O
or O
11q23/MLL O
rearrangements O
had O
low O
rates O
of O
deletion O
(11%, O
15%, O
13%), O
whereas O
patients O
with O
t(9;22), O
t(1;19), O
TLX3, O
or O
TLX1 O
rearrangements O
had O
higher O
frequencies O
(61%, O
42%, O
78%, O
and O
89%). O
In O
conclusion, O
CDKN2A O
deletion O
is O
a O
significant O
secondary O
abnormality O
in O
childhood O
ALL O
strongly O
correlated O
with O
phenotype O
and O
genotype. O
The O
variation O
in O
the O
incidence O
of O

may O
explain O
its O
inconsistent O

METHODS-RESULTS: O
Compared O
with O

hGRalpha, O
the O

demonstrated O
a I-MUT

transactivate O
the O
glucocorticoid-inducible O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O

we O
screened O
2 I-MUT
Brazilian O

sequencing O
the O

PURPOSE: O
Juvenile O
epithelial O
corneal O
dystrophy O
of O
Meesmann O
(MCD, O
OMIM O
122100) O
is O
a O
dominantly O
inherited O
disorder O
characterized O
by O
fragility O
of O
the O
anterior O
corneal O
epithelium O
and O
intraepithelial O
microcyst O
formation. O
Although O
the O
disease O
is O
generally O
mild O
and O
affected O
individuals O
are O
often O
asymptomatic, O
some O
suffer O
from O
recurrent O
erosions O
leading O
to O
lacrimation, O
photophobia, O
and O
deterioration O
in O
visual O
acuity. O
MCD O
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
keratin O
3 I-MUT
(KRT3) O
or O
keratin O
12 O
(KRT12) O
genes, O
which O
encode O
cornea-specific O
cytoskeletal O
proteins. O
Seventeen O
mutations O
in O
KRT12 O
and O
two O
in O
KRT3 O
have O
been O
described O
so O
far. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
genetic O
background O
of O
MCD O
in O
a O
Polish O
family. O
METHODS: O
We O
report O
on O
a O
three-generation O
family O
with O
MCD. O
Epithelial O
lesions O
characteristic O
for O
MCD O
were O
visualized O
with O
slit-lamp O
examination O
and O
confirmed O
by O
in O

Using O
genomic O
DNA O
as O
a O
template, O
all O
coding O
regions O
of O
KRT3 O
and O
KRT12 O
were O
amplified O
and O
sequenced. O
Presence O
of O
the O
mutation O
was O
verified O
with O
restriction O
endonuclease O

RESULTS: O
In O
the O
proband, O

of O
the O
polymerase O

(PCR) O
product O
from O
amplified O
coding O

revealed O
a O
novel O
1493A>T B-MUT
heterozygous O
missense O
mutation O
in O
exon O
7 O
of O
KRT3, O
which O
predicts O
the O
substitution O
of O
glutamic O
acid O
for O
valine O
at O
codon O
498 I-MUT
(E498V). O
Using O
PCR-Restriction O
Fragment O
Length O
Polymorphism O
(RFLP) O
analysis, O
the O
mutation O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
segregate O
with O
the O
disease O
(four O
affected O
members, O
three O
non-affected) O
and O
to O
be O
absent O
in O
100 O
controls O
from O
the O
Polish O
population, O
indicating O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
common O
polymorphism. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Location O
of O
the O
E498V B-MUT
mutation O
emphasizes O
the O
functional O
relevance O
of O
the O
highly O

Identification O
of O
a O
gain-of-function O

of O
the O
prolactin O

in O
women O
with O
benign O

tumors. O
There O
is O
currently O
no O
known O
genetic O
disease O
linked O
to O
prolactin O
(Prl) O
or O
its O
receptor O
(PrlR) O
in O
humans. O
Given O
the O
essential O
role O
of O
this O
hormonal O
system O
in O
breast O
physiology, O
we O
reasoned O
that O
genetic O
anomalies O
of O
Prl/PrlR O
genes O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
occurrence O
of O
breast O
diseases O
with O
high O
proliferative O
potential. O
Multiple O
fibroadenomas O
(MFA) O
are O
benign O
breast O
tumors O
which O
appear O
most O
frequently O
in O
young O
women, O
including O
at O
puberty, O
when O
Prl O
has O
well-recognized O
proliferative O
actions O
on O
the O
breast. O
In O
a O
prospective O
study O
involving O
74 O
MFA O
patients O
and O
170 O
control O
subjects, O
we O
identified O
four O
patients O
harboring O
a O
heterozygous O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphism O
in O
exon O
6 I-MUT
of O
the O
PrlR O
gene, O
encoding O
Ile(146)-->Leu B-MUT
substitution O
in O
its O
extracellular O
domain. O
This O
sole O
substitution O
was O
sufficient O
to O
confer O
constitutive O
activity O
to O
the O
receptor O
variant O
(PrlR(I146L)), O
as O
assessed O
in O
three O
reconstituted O
cell O
models O
(Ba/F3, O

by O

toward O
a O
Prl-responsive O
reporter O
gene, O
and O
(iv) O
cell O

and O

death. O
Constitutive O
activity O
of O
PrlR(I146L) O
in O
the O
breast O
sample O
from O
a O
patient O
was O
supported O
by O
increased O

This O
is O
a O
unique O
description O
of O
a O
functional O
mutation O
of O
the O
PrlR O
associated O
with O
a O
human O
disease. O
Hallmarks O
of O
constitutive O
activity O
were O
all O
reversed O
by O
a O
specific O
PrlR O
antagonist, O
which O
opens O
potential O
therapeutic O
approaches O
for O
MFA, O
or O
any O

that O
could O

Genetic O
variation O
in O
an O
individual O
human O
exome. O
There O
is O
much O
interest O
in O
characterizing O
the O
variation O
in O
a O
human O
individual, O
because O
this O
may O
elucidate O
what O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
a O
person's O
phenotype, O
thereby O
enabling O
personalized O
genomics. O
We O
focus O
here O
on O
the O
variants O
in O
a O
person's O
'exome,' O
which O
is O
the O
set O
of O
exons O
in O
a O
genome, O
because O
the O
exome O
is O
believed O
to O
harbor O
much O
of O
the O
functional O
variation. O
We O
provide O
an O
analysis O
of O
the O
approximately O
12,500 O
variants O
that O
affect O
the O
protein O
coding O
portion O
of O
an O
individual's O
genome. O
We O
identified O
approximately O
10,400 O
nonsynonymous O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
(nsSNPs) O
in O
this O
individual, O
of O
which O
approximately O
15-20% O
are O
rare O
in O
the O
human O
population. O
We O
predict O
approximately O
1,500 O
nsSNPs O
affect O
protein O
function O
and O
these O
tend O
be O
heterozygous, O
rare, O
or O
novel. O
Of O
the O
approximately O
700 O
coding O
indels, O
approximately O
half O
tend O
to O
have O
lengths O
that O
are O
a O
multiple O
of O
three, O
which O
causes O
insertions/deletions O
of O
amino O
acids O
in O
the O
corresponding O
protein, O
rather O
than O
introducing O
frameshifts. O
Coding O
indels O
also O
occur O
frequently O
at O
the O
termini O
of O
genes, O
so O
even O
if O
an O
indel O
causes O
a O
frameshift, O
an O
alternative O
start O
or O
stop O
site O
in O
the O
gene O
can O
still O
be O
used O
to O
make O
a O
functional O
protein. O
In O
summary, O
we O
reduced O
the O
set O
of O
approximately O
12,500 O
nonsilent O
coding O
variants O
by O
approximately O
8-fold O
to O
a O
set O
of O
variants O
that O
are O
most O
likely O
to O
have O
major O
effects O
on O
their O
proteins' O
functions. O
This O
is O
our O
first O
glimpse O
of O
an O
individual's O
exome O
and O
a O
snapshot O
of O
the O
current O
state O
of O
personalized O
genomics. O
The O
majority O
of O
coding O
variants O
in O
this O
individual O
are O
common O
and O
appear O
to O
be O
functionally O
neutral. O
Our O
results O
also O
indicate O
that O
some O
variants O
can O
be O
used O
to O
improve O
the O
current O
NCBI O
human O
reference O
genome. O
As O
more O
genomes O
are O
sequenced, O
many O
rare O
variants O
and O
non-SNP O
variants O
will O
be O
discovered. O
We O
present O
an O
approach O
to O
analyze O
the O
coding O
variation O
in O
humans O
by O
proposing O
multiple O
bioinformatic O
methods O
to O
hone O
in O
on O
possible O
functional O
variation. O

OBJECTIVE: O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
studied O
the O
molecular O

APL O
in O
three O

METHOD: O
Molecular O

glomerulopathy. O
BACKGROUND/AIMS: O
Lipoprotein O
glomerulopathy O
(LPG) O
is O
a B-MUT
rare O
disease O
characterized O
by O
thrombus-like O
substances O
in I-MUT
markedly O
dilated O
glomerular O
capillaries O
and O
elevated O
plasma O
levels O
of O
apolipoprotein O
E O
(apoE). O
Previous O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
genetic O
disorders O
of O
apoE O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
LPG, O
but O
LPG O
may O
not O
be O
caused O
by O
apoE O
gene O
mutations O
in I-MUT
Chinese O
patients. O
This O
study O
investigated O
the O
association O
of O
a B-MUT
new O
variant O
of O
apoE O
with O
LPG O
in I-MUT
a B-MUT
Chinese O
family. O
METHODS: O
The O
apoE O
gene O
in I-MUT
a B-MUT

with O
4 O

patients O
was O
sequenced. O
The O
polymerase O

RESULTS: O
A O
novel O

of O
the O
apoE O
gene O
was O
identified O
in I-MUT

grandsons O
was O
a B-MUT
heterozygous O
carrier O
of O
apoE O
Guangzhou, O
although O
he O
did O
not O
have O
proteinuria. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
results O
of O
this O
study O
suggest O
that O
apoE O
(arginine O
150 I-MUT

is O
a B-MUT
novel O
apoE O
variant O
that O
etiologically O
related O

BACKGROUND: O
Osteoporosis O
is O
defined O
as O
the O

that O
leads O
to O

in O
many O
candidate O
genes O
that O
have O
been O
associated O

To O
investigate O
single O

polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
that O
are O
associated O
with O
osteoporosis, O
we O
examined O
the O
genetic O
variation O
among O
Koreans O
by O
analyzing O
81 O
genes O
according O
to O
their O
function O
in O

METHODS: O
We O

using O
24 O

Using O
the O

RESULTS: O
We O

942 O
variants, O
including O
888 O

Of O
the O
SNPs, O
557 O
(63%) O
had O
been O
previously O
identified O
and O
331 O
(37%) O
were O

When O
compared O
SNPs O
in O
the O

1% O
(or O

20% O
of O
those O
in O

from O
the O
Hardy-Weinberg O

In O
addition, O
an O

showed O
that O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
among O
Korean, O

Chinese O
and O
Japanese O
populations, O
but O
African O
and O

Nevertheless, O
in O

patterns O
among O
the O

CONCLUSION: O
Through O
the O

118 O
unknown O
SNPs O
with O
a O

of O
the O

of O
the O
human O

gene O
causing O
generalized O

resistance. O
BACKGROUND: O
Generalized O
glucocorticoid O
resistance O
is O
a I-MUT
rare O
condition O
characterized O
by O
partial, O
end-organ O
insensitivity O
to O
glucocorticoids, O

in O
adrenocorticotropic O

and O
increased O

of O
adrenal O

We O
have O

of O
glucocorticoid O

caused O
by O
a I-MUT
novel O
mutation O
of O
the O

studied O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
through O
which O
the O

METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
We O
identified O
a I-MUT
novel, O

C) I-MUT
substitution I-MUT
at I-MUT

Compared O
with O
the O

and O
an O
abnormal O

with O
the O

The O
mutant O
receptor O
preserved O
its O
ability O
to O
bind O

DNA O
and O
exerted O
a I-MUT
dominant-negative O
effect O
on I-MUT
the O
wild-type O
hGRalpha O
only O
after O
a I-MUT
short O
duration O
of O

to O
the O
ligand. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
mutant O
receptor O
hGRalphaF737L O
causes O
generalized O
glucocorticoid O

because O
of O
decreased O

RESULTS: O
Sequencing O

RESULTS: O
When O

the O
presence O
of O
at O

CONCLUSION: O
Variants O

(SNP) O
array. O
FINDINGS: O
Multiple O
areas O
of O
LOH O
and O

were O
seen. O
The O
most O
commonly O
observed O
area O
of O
LOH O
was O
on O
chromosome O
arm O
11q O
(15/22 O
samples; O
68%). O
Chromosome O

0.016). O
Chromosome O
1p O
LOH O
was O
seen O
in O
one-third O
of O
cases. O
LOH O
events O
on O
chromosomes O
11q O
and O
1p O
were O
generally O
accompanied O
by O
copy O
number O

within O
these O
regions. O
The O
one O
exception O
was O
on O
chromosome O
11p, O
where O
LOH O
in O
all O
four O
cases O
was O
accompanied O
by O
normal O
copy O

was O
most O
frequently O
observed O
on O
chromosome O
arm O
17q O
(21/22 O
samples; O
95%) O
and O
was O
associated O
with O

OBJECTIVES: O
This O
study O
was O
conducted O
with O
two O
objectives. O
The O
first O
was O
to O
estimate O
the O
frequency O
of O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
(LOH) O
of O
the O
RB1 O
gene O
as O
a O
mechanism O
in O
disease O
causation O
in O
tumors O
of O
patients O
from O
India. O
The O
second O
objective O
was O
to O
employ O
RB1 O
molecular O
deletion O
and O
microsatellite-based O
linkage O
analysis O
as O
laboratory O
tools, O
while O
counseling O
families O
with O
a O
history O
of O
retinoblastoma O
(RB). O
METHODS: O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
peripheral O
blood O
and O
tumors O
of O
54 O
RB O
patients O
and O
their O
relatives. O
Eight O
fluorescent O
microsatellite O
markers, O
both O
intragenic O
and O
flanking O
the O
RB1 O
gene, O
were O
used. O
After O
PCR O
amplification, O
samples O
were O
run O
on O
an O
ABI O
PRISM O
310 O
genetic O
analyzer O
for O
LOH, O
deletion O
detection, O
and O
haplotype O
generation. O
RESULTS: O
LOH O
was O
found O
in O
conjunction O
with O
tumor O
formation O
in O
72.9% O
of O
RB O
patients O
(39/54 O
patients; O
p=0.001; O
95% O
CI O
0.6028, O
0.8417); O
however, O
we O
could O
not O
associate O
various O
other O
clinical O
parameters O
of O
RB O
patients O
with O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
RB1 O
LOH. O
Seven O
germline O
deletions O
(13% O
of O
RB O
patients) O
were O
identified, O
and O
the O
maternal O
allele O
was O
more O
frequently O
lost O
(p=0.01). O
A O
disease O
co-segregating O
haplotype O
was O
detected O
in O
two O
hereditary O
autosomal O
dominant O
cases. O
CONCLUSION: O
LOH O
of O
the O
RB1 O
gene O
could O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
tumor O
formation. O
Large O
deletions O
involving O
RB1 O
were O
observed, O
and O
a O
disease O
co-segregating O
haplotype O
was O
used O
for O
indirect O
genetic O
testing. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
report O
from O
India O
where O
molecular O
testing O
has O
been O
applied O
for O
RB O
families O
in O

practice O
in O
India, O
there O
is O
an O
emerging O
trend O
towards O
the O
application O
of O
genetical O
knowledge O
in O
clinical O
practice. O

The O
G51S B-MUT
purine O
nucleoside O

polymorphism O
is O
associated O
with O

in O
Alzheimer's O

patients. O
Alzheimer's O
disease O
(AD) O
is O
a O
polygenic O
and O
multifactorial O
complex O
disease, O
whose O
etiopathology O
is O
still O
unclear, O
however O
several O
genetic O
factors O
have O
shown O
to O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
the O
disease. O
Purine O
nucleotides O
and O
nucleosides O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
brain. O
Besides O
their O
role O
in O
neurotransmission O
and O
neuromodulation, O
they O
are O
involved O
in O
trophic O
factor O
release, O
apoptosis, O
and O

These O
mediators O
may O
also O
have O
a O
pivotal O
role O
in O
the O
control O
of O
neurodegenerative O
processes O
associated O
with O

In O
this O
report O
the O

gene, O
resulting O
in O
the O
amino O

was O
investigated O
in O
a O
large O
population O
of O
AD O
patients O
(n=321) O
and O
non-demented O
control O
(n=208). O
The O
PNP O
polymorphism O
distribution O
was O
not O
different O
between O
patients O
and O

The O
polymorphism O
distribution O
was O
also O
analyzed O
in O
AD O
patients O
stratified O
according O
to O
differential O
progressive O
rate O
of O
cognitive O

during O
a O
2-year O
follow-up. O
An O
increased O
representation O

was O
observed O
in O
AD O
patients O
with O
fast O
cognitive O
deterioration O
in O
comparison O
with O
that O
from O
patients O
with O
slow O

rate. O
Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
G51S B-MUT
PNP O
polymorphism O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
faster O
rate O
of O

in O
AD O
patients, O
highlighting O
the O
important O
role O
of O

in O
the O

A I-MUT
novel O
mutation O
(E333D) O
in O
the O
thyroid O
hormone O
beta O
receptor O
causing O
resistance O
to O
thyroid O

syndrome. O
Resistance O
to O
thyroid O
hormone O
(RTH) O
is O
an O
inherited O
syndrome O
characterized O
by O
elevated O
serum O
thyroid O
hormones O
(TH), O
failure O
to O
suppress O
pituitary O
thyroid O
stimulating O
hormone O
(TSH) O
secretion, O
and O
variable O
peripheral O

to O
TH. O
The O
disorder O
is O
associated O
with O
diverse O
mutations O
in O
the O
thyroid O
hormone O
beta O
receptor O
(TRbeta). O
Here, O
we O
report O
a O
novel O
natural O
RTH O
mutation O
(E333D) O
located O
in O
the O
large O
carboxy-terminal O
ligand O
binding O
domain O
of O
TRbeta. O
The O
mutation O
was O
identified O
in O
a O
22-year-old O
French O
woman O
coming O
to O
medical O
attention O
because O
of O
an O
increasing O
overweight. O
Biochemical O
tests O
showed O
elevated O
free O
thyroxine O
(T4: O
20.8 O
pg/ml O
(normal, O
8.5-18)) O
and O
triiodothyronine O
(T3: O
5.7 O
pg/ml O
(normal, O
1.4-4)) O
in O
the O
serum, O
together O
with O
an O
inappropriately O
nonsuppressed O
TSH O
level O
of O
4.7 O
mU/ml O
(normal, O
0.4-4). O
Her O
father O
and O
her O
brother's O
serum O
tests O
also O
showed O
biochemical O
abnormalities O
consistent O
with O
RTH. O
Direct O
sequencing O
of O
the O
TRbeta O
gene O
revealed O
a O
heterozygous O
transition O
1284A>C B-MUT
in O
exon O
9 O
resulting O
in O
substitution O
of O
glutamic O
acid O
333 I-MUT
by O
aspartic O
acid O
residue O
(E333D). O
Further O
functional O
analyses O
of O
the O
novel O
TRbeta O
mutant O
were O
conducted. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
E333D B-MUT
mutation O
neither O
significantly O
affected O
the O
affinity O
of O
the O
receptor O
for O
T3 O
nor O
modified O
heterodimer O
formation O
with O
retinoid O
X O
receptor O
(RXR) O
when O
bound O
to O
DNA. O
However, O
in O
transient O
transfection O
assays, O
the O
E333D B-MUT
TRbeta O
mutant O
exhibited O
impaired O
transcriptional O
regulation O
on O
two O
distinct O
positively O
regulated O
thyroid O
response O
elements O
(F2- O
and O
DR4-TREs) O
as O
well O
as O
on O
the O
negatively O
regulated O
human O
TSHalpha O
promoter. O
Moreover, O
a O
dominant O
inhibition O
of O
the O
wild-type O
TRbeta O
counterpart O
transactivation O
function O
was O
observed O
on O
both O
a O
positive O
(F2-TRE) O
and O
a O
negative O
(TSHalpha) O
promoter. O
These O
results O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
the O
E333D B-MUT
TRbeta O
mutation O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
RTH O
phenotype O
in O
the O
proposita's O
family. O

Homozygous O
deletion O
related O

PURPOSE: O
Retinitis O
punctata O
albescens O
(RPA) O
is O
an O
infrequently O
occurring O
form O
of O
autosomal O
recessive O
(and O
rarely O
dominant) O
retinal O
dystrophy O
featuring O
early-onset O
severe O
night O
blindness O
and O
tiny, O
dotlike, O
white O

in O
the O
fundus. O
RPA O
is O
associated O
mostly O
with O
mutations O
in O
RLBP1 O
and O
occasionally O
in O
RHO, O
RDS, O
and O
RDH5. O
In O
this O
study, O
mutations O
were O
sought O
in O
RLBP1, O
which O
encodes O
the O
retinol O
binding O
protein O
CRALBP O
in O
patients O
with O
typical O
RPA. O
METHODS: O
Clinical O
investigation O
included O
funduscopy, O
visual O
field O
testing, O
electroretinogram O
recording, O
and O
adaptometry. O
The O
7 O
coding O
exons O
(3-9) O
of O
RLBP1 O
and O
the O
15th O
(last) O
exon O
of O
ABDH2 O
were O
PCR O
amplified O
and O
sequenced. O
Long-distance O
PCR O
and O
cloning O
of O
genomic O
DNA O
were O
performed O
to O
characterize O
the O
deletion. O
RESULTS: O
The O
study O
involved O
a O
24-year-old O
Moroccan O
patient O
with O
typical O
RPA, O
born O
of O
first-cousin O
parents. O
He O
carried O
a O
7.36-kb O
homozygous O
deletion O
encompassing O
the O
last O
3 O
exons O
of O
RLBP1 O
(7, O
8, O
and O
9) O
and O
part O
of O
the O
intergenic O
region O
between O
RLBP1 O
and O
ABHD2, O
which O
lies O
downstream O
of O
RLBP1. O
This O
deletion O
abolishes O
the O
retinal O
binding O
site O
of O
CRALBP. O
The O
telomeric O
breakpoint O
of O
the O
deletion O
(in O
RLBP1 O
intron O
6) O
is O
embedded O
in O
an O
Alu O
element, O
whereas O
the O
centromeric O
breakpoint O
(in O
the O
intergenic O
region) O
lies O
between O
two O
Alu O
elements O
placed O
in O
the O
opposite O
orientation. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Because O
of O
the O
high O
density O
of O
Alu O
elements O
in O
RLBP1, O
a O
systematic O
search O
should O
be O
made O
for O
deletions O
in O
this O
gene O
when O
one O
or O
both O

BACKGROUND: O
During O
infancy, O
a O
male O
patient O
experienced O
several O
life-threatening O
bleeding O
episodes. O
Standard O
coagulation O
tests O
revealed O
that O
the O
patient's O
plasma O
prothrombin O
activity O
was O
8%, O
while O
his O
father's O
and O
mother's O
levels O
were O
74% O
and O
62%, O
respectively. O
OBJECTIVES: O
A I-MUT
molecular O
genetic O
approach O
was O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
molecular O
basis O
of O
prothrombin O
deficiency O
within O
the O
family. O
PATIENT/METHODS: O
Prothrombin O
genomic O
DNA O

were O
amplified O
by O
using O
the O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR). O
In O
addition, O
liver O
cDNA O
fragments O
were O
amplified O
from O
the O
patient O
by O
using O
reverse O
transcription O
(RT) O
and O
PCR. O
The O
nucleotide O

of O
the O

were O
determined. O
RESULTS: O
A I-MUT
novel, O
heterozygous O

confirmed O
a O
deletion O
(g.10435_10809del) O
in O
the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
patient O
has O
a O
maternally-inherited O
point O
mutation O
(R-4Q) O
and O
a O
paternally-inherited O
deletion. O
By O
analogy O
with O
the O
previously O
reported O
factor O
IX O
San O
Dimas, O
the O
R-4Q B-MUT
mutation O
probably O
causes O
under-carboxylation O
of O
prothrombin O
and O
poor O
cleavage O
of O
the O
propeptide O
in O
the O
hepatocyte. O
The O
deletion O
probably O
results O
in O
a O
polypeptide O
that O
lacks O
50 O
amino O
acids O
from O
the O
protease O
domain; O
this O
is O
likely O
to O
impair O
folding, O
secretion, O
stability O
and/or O
activity O
of O
the O
truncated O
prothrombin. O
The O
two O
mutations O
combine O
to O
give O
the O

Mutational O

of O
the O

was O
performed O
by O

Biochemical O

phylogenetic O

performed. O
RESULTS: O
Fundi O
of O

A I-MUT

was O
found O
in O
seven O
affected O

members O
and O
was O
absent O
from O
an O

member O
and O
98 O

Bioinformatic O
analyses O
indicate O
that O
histidine O
158 I-MUT
is I-MUT
an O
evolutionarily O
conserved O
residue O
in O
most O
vertebrate O
TIMP O
homologs O
and O
predict O
that O
substitution O
by O
arginine O
disrupts O
TIMP3 O
function. O
The O
mutant O
protein O
appears O
to O
be O
expressed O
by O
fibroblasts O
from O
an O
affected O
family O
member. O
Molecular O
modeling O
suggests O
that O
TIMP3 O
residue O
158 I-MUT
may O
be O
part O
of O
a O

CONCLUSION: O
A I-MUT
novel O
mutation O
in O
TIMP3 O
causes O
a O
late-onset O

patients. O
OBJECTIVES: O
Dystonia O
is I-MUT
a O
common O
movement O
disorder. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
is I-MUT
to O
examine O
the O
relative O
distribution O
of O
the O
primary O
dystonia O
subtypes O
and O
identify O
mutation O
(s) O
in O
the O
DYT1 O
gene O
in O
Indian O
patients. O
MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
Primary O
dystonia O
patients O
(n O
= O
178) O
and O
controls O
(n O
= O
63), O
lacking O
any O
symptoms O
of O
the O
disease, O
were O
recruited O
for O
the O
study O
from O
eastern O
India. O
The O
nucleotide O
variants O
in O
the O
DYT1 O
gene O
were O
identified O
by O
carrying O
out O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction, O
single O

conformation O
polymorphism, O
and O
DNA O
sequencing. O
RESULTS: O
Unlike O
other O
reports, O
pain O
and/or O
tremor O
was O
more O
common O
in O
our O
sporadic O
patients O
than O
in O
familial O
cases. O
Three O
reported O
and O
two O
novel O
changes O
were O
identified O
in O
this O
gene. O
The O
homozygous O
genotype O
(G,G) O
for O
a O
missense O
variant O
(c.646G O

C; O
Asp216His) O
was O
significantly O
over-represented O
in O
the O
patients O
compared O
with O
controls O
(P O
< O

However, O
the O
commonly O
reported O
3 O
bp O

(904-906delGAG) O
was O
not O
detected. O
CONCLUSION: O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
DYT1 O
gene O
might O
have O
a O
limited O
role O
in O

gene O
in O
subjects O
with O
multiple O

neoplasia O
type O
1 O
(MEN1) O
is O
characterized O
by O
parathyroid, O
enteropancreatic O
endocrine O
and O
pituitary O
adenomas O
as O
well O
as O
germline O
mutation O
of O
the O
MEN1 O
gene. O
We O
describe O
2 O
families O
with O
MEN1 O
with O
novel O
mutations O
in O
the O
MEN1 O
gene. O
One O
family O
was O
of O
Turkish O
origin, O
and O
the O
index O
patient O
had O
primary O
hyperparathyroidism O
(PHPT) O
plus O
a O
prolactinoma; O
three O
relatives O
had O
PHPT O
only. O
The O
index O
patient O
in O
the O
second O
family O
was O
a O
46-yr-old O
woman O
of O
Chinese O
origin O
living O
in O
Taiwan. O
This O
patient O
presented O
with O
a O
complaint O
of O
epigastric O
pain O
and O
watery O
diarrhea O
over O
the O
past O
3 O
months, O
and O
had O
undergone O
subtotal O
parathyroidectomy O
and O
enucleation O
of O
pancreatic O
islet O
cell O
tumor O
about O
10 O
yr O
before. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
prolactinoma. O
Sequence O
analysis O
of O
the O
MEN1 O
gene O
from O
leukocyte O
genomic O
DNA O
revealed O
heterozygous O
mutations O
in O
both O
probands. O
The O
Turkish O
patient O
and O
her O
affected O
relatives O
all O
had O
a O
heterozygous O
A I-MUT
to O
G I-MUT
transition O
at O
codon O
557 O
(AAG-->GAG) O
of O
exon O
10 O
of O
MEN1 O
that O
results O
in O
a O
replacement O
of O
lysine O
by O
glutamic O
acid. O
The O
Chinese O
index O
patient O
and O
one O
of O
her O
siblings O
had O
a O
heterozygous O
mutation O
at O
codon O
418 O
of O
exon O
9 O
(GAC-->TAT) O
that O
results O
in O
a O
substitution O
of O

by O
tyrosine. O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
have O
identified O
2 O
novel O
missense O
mutations O
in O
the O
MEN1 O
gene. O

Single O

gene O
are O
associated O
with O
the O

which O
is O
necessary O
for O

We O
investigated O
whether O
single O

and, O
therefore, O
only O

had O
a O
1.7-fold O

(CI) O
1.09-2.66; O
P=0.020] O
for O

based O
on O
three O

and O
rs3818247) O
representing O
the O
linkage O

blocks O
in O
our O
study O

indicated O
that O
the O

was O
dependent O
on O
the O
number O
of O

Our O
results O
suggest O
that O

in O
Danish O
Familial O
Hypercholesterolemic O
subjects. O
BACKGROUND: O
Familial O
Hypercholesterolemia O
is O
a O
common O
autosomal O
dominantly O
inherited O
disease O
that O
is O
most O
frequently O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
gene O
encoding O
the O
receptor O
for O
low O
density O
lipoproteins O
(LDLR). O
Deletions O
and O
other O
major O
structural O
rearrangements O
of O
the O
LDLR O
gene O
account O
for O
approximately O
5% O
of O
the O
mutations O
in O
many O
populations. O
METHODS: O
Five O
genomic O
deletions O
in O
the O
LDLR O
gene O
were O
characterized O
by O
amplification O
of O
mutated O
alleles O
and O
sequencing O
to O
identify O
genomic O
breakpoints. O
A O
diagnostic O
assay O
based O
on O
duplex O
PCR O
for O
the O
exon O
7-8 O
deletion O
was O
developed O
to O
discriminate O
between O
heterozygotes O
and O
normals, O
and O
bioinformatic O
analyses O
were O
used O
to O
identify O
interspersed O
repeats O
flanking O
the O
deletions. O
RESULTS: O
In O
one O
case O
15 O
bp O
had O
been O
inserted O
at O
the O
site O
of O
the O
deleted O
DNA, O
and, O
in O
all O
five O
cases, O
Alu O
elements O
flanked O
the O
sites O
where O
deletions O
had O
occurred. O
An O
assay O
developed O
to O
discriminate O
the O
wildtype O
and O
the O
deletion O
allele O
in O
a O
simple O
duplex O
PCR O
detected O
three O
FH O
patients O
as O
heterozygotes, O
and O
two O
individuals O
with O
normal O
lipid O
values O
were O
detected O
as O
normal O
homozygotes. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
identification O
of O
the O
breakpoints O
should O
make O
it O
possible O
to O
develop O
specific O
tests O
for O
these O
mutations, O
and O
the O
data O
provide O
further O
evidence O
for O
the O

in O
a O
Chinese O
population: O

analysis. O
BACKGROUND: O
Accumulative O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
low O
folate O
intake O
is O
associated O
with O
increased O
risk O
of O
breast O
cancer. O
Polymorphisms O
in O
genes O
involved O
in O
folate O
metabolism O
may O
influence O
DNA O

nucleotide O
synthesis, O
and O
thus O
individual O
susceptibility O
to O
cancer. O
Thymidylate O
synthase O
(TYMS) O
is O
a O
key O
enzyme O
that O
participates O
in O
folate O
metabolism O
and O
catalyzes O
the O
conversion O
of O

Two O

were O
suggested O
to O

METHODS: O
To O
test O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
polymorphisms O
of O
the O
TYMS O
gene O
are O
associated O
with O
risk O
of O
breast O
cancer, O
we O
genotyped O
these O
two O
polymorphisms O
in O
a O
case-control O
study O
of O
432 O
incident O
cases O
with O
invasive O
breast O
cancer O
and O
473 O
cancer-free O

in O
a O
Chinese O
population. O
RESULTS: O
We O
found O
that O
the O
distribution O
of O
TS3'-UTR O
(1494del6) O
genotype O
frequencies O
were O
significantly O
different O
between O
the O
cases O
and O

(P O

0.026). O
Compared O
with O
the O
TS3'-UTR O
del6/del6 O
wild-type O
genotype, O
a O
significantly O
reduced O

was O
associated O
with O

(adjusted O

not O
the O

genotype O
(OR O

0.82-1.46). O
Furthermore, O
breast O
cancer O
risks O
associated O
with O
the O
TS3'-UTR O

were O
more O
evident O
in O
older O

However, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
for O
an O
association O
between O
the O
TSER O
polymorphism O
and O

risks. O
CONCLUSION: O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
the O

COX-2 O

the O

The O

We O

the O

is O
responsible O
for O

The O
objective O
of O
this O

was O
to O
test O
whether O
other O
types O

in O
the O

Here, O
we O
screened O
942 O
Japanese O
patients O
with O
hypertension O
for O
the O
S810L B-MUT
mutation O
in O
exon O

in O
the O
MR. O
We O
did O
not O
identify O
the O
S810L B-MUT

in O
our O

indicating O
that O
S810L B-MUT
does O
not O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
etiology O
of O
essential O
hypertension O
in O

However, O
we O
identified O
a O
novel O

mutation, O
F826Y, O
in O
three O
patients O
in O
a O
heterozygous O
state, O
in O
addition O
to O
four O
single O

polymorphisms, O
including O
one O
synonymous O

(L809L). O
The O
F826Y B-MUT
mutation O
is O
present O
in O
the O
MR O
hormone-binding O
domain O
and O
might O
affect O
the O

The O
F826Y B-MUT
mutation O
was O
also O
identified O
in O
13 O
individuals O
(5 O
hypertensives O
and O
8 I-MUT
normotensives) O
in O
a O
Japanese O
general O
population O
(n=3,655). O
The O
allele O
frequency O
was O
0.00178. O
The O
frequencies O
of O
the O
F826Y B-MUT
mutation O
in O
the O
hypertensive O
population O
(3/942) O
and O
in O
the O
hypertensive O
group O
(5/ O
1,480) O
and O
the O
normotensive O
group O
(8/2,175) O
in O
the O
general O
population O
were O
not O
significantly O
different, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
mutation O
does O
not O
greatly O
affect O
hypertension. O
Although O
it O
is O
unclear O
at O
present O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
F826Y B-MUT
mutation O
makes O
a O
substantial O
contribution O
to O
the O
mineralocorticoid O
receptor O
activity, O
this O
missense O
mutation O
may O
contribute, O
to O
some O
extent, O

Four O

Such O

Amplification, O

are O
hallmarks O

In O

a O
variety O

have O
emerged O
measuring O

Similarly, O
loss-of-heterozygosity O
events O
have O
been O
finely O
mapped O
using O
high-throughput O

technologies. O
We O
have O
developed O
a O
probe-level O
allele-specific O
quantitation O
procedure O
that O
extracts O
both O
copy O
number O
and O
allelotype O
information O
from O
single O

(SNP) O
array O
data O
to O
arrive O
at O
allele-specific O
copy O

Our O
approach O
applies O
an O
expectation-maximization O
algorithm O
to O
a O
model O
derived O
from O
a O
novel O
classification O
of O
SNP O
array O
probes. O
This O
method O
is O
the O
first O
to O
our O
knowledge O
that O
is O
able O
to O
(a) O
determine O
the O
generalized O
genotype O
of O
aberrant O
samples O
at O
each O
SNP O
site O
(e.g., O
CCCCT O
at O
an O
amplified O
site), O
and O
(b) O
infer O
the O
copy O
number O
of O
each O
parental O
chromosome O
across O
the O
genome. O
With O
this O
method, O
we O
are O
able O
to O
determine O
not O
just O
where O
amplifications O
and O
deletions O
occur, O
but O
also O
the O
haplotype O
of O
the O
region O
being O
amplified O
or O

The O
merit O
of O
our O
model O
and O
general O
approach O
is O
demonstrated O
by O
very O
precise O
genotyping O
of O
normal O
samples, O
and O
our O
allele-specific O
copy O

inferences O
are O
validated O
using O
PCR O
experiments. O
Applying O
our O
method O
to O
a O
collection O
of O
lung O
cancer O
samples, O
we O
are O
able O
to O
conclude O
that O
amplification O
is O
essentially O
monoallelic, O
as O
would O
be O
expected O
under O
the O
mechanisms O
currently O
believed O
responsible O
for O
gene O
amplification. O
This O
suggests O
that O
a O
specific O
parental O
chromosome O
may O
be O
targeted O
for O
amplification, O
whether O
because O
of O
germ O

or O
somatic O

glaucoma, O
one O
of O
the O
major O

In O
this O

we O
sought O
to O
establish O
the O
genetic O

and O
to O
find O
the O

METHODS: O
Two O
microsatellites, O
1 O
insertion/deletion, O
and O
8 O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
in O
the O
regulatory O

were O
genotyped O
in O
200 O

Also, O
the O

was O
examined O
for O

RESULTS: O
There O
was O
a O

In O
EMSA, O
the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
results, O
together O
with O
other O
studies O
on O
this O
gene O
and O
the O
CCTTT-microsatellite, O
establish, O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
a O
genetic O
association O
of O

PURPOSE: O
Congenital O
microcoria O
is O
a O
rare O
autosomal O
dominant O
developmental O
disorder O
of O
the O
iris O
associated O
with O
myopia O
and O
juvenile O
open O

Linkage O
to O
the O
chromosomal O
locus O
13q31-q32 O
has O
previously O
been O
reported O
in O
a O
large O
French O
family. O
In O
the O
current O
study, O
a O
three O
generation O
Asian O
Indian O
family O
with O
15 O
congenital O
microcoria O
(pupils O
with O
a O
diameter O
<2 O
mm) O
affected O
members O
was O
studied O
for O
linkage O
to O
candidate O
microsatellite O
markers O
at O
the O
13q31-q32 O
locus. O
METHODS: O
Twenty-four O
members O
of O
the O
family O
were O
clinically O
examined O
and O
genomic O
DNA O
was O
extracted. O
Microsatellite O
markers O
at O
13q31-q32 O
were O
PCR O
amplified O
and O
run O
on O
an O
ABI O
Prism O
310 O
genetic O
analyzer O
and O
genotyped O
with O
the O
GeneScan O
analysis. O
Two O
point O
and O
multipoint O
linkage O
analyses O
were O
performed O
using O
the O
MLINK O
and O
SUPERLINK O
programs. O
RESULTS: O
Peak O
two O
point O
LOD O
scores O
of O
3.5, O
4.7, O
and O
5.3 O
were O
found O
co-incident O
with O
consecutive O
markers O
D13S154, O
DCT, O
and O
D13S1280. O
Multipoint O
analysis O
revealed O
a O
4 I-MUT
cM O
region O
encompassing O
D13S1300 O
to O
D13S1280 O
where O
the O
LOD O
remains O
just O
over O
6.0 O
Thus O
we O
confirm O
localization O
of O
the O
congenital O
microcoria O
locus O
to O
chromosomal O
locus O
13q31-q32. O
In O
addition, O
eight O
individuals O
who O
had O
both O
microcoria O
and O
glaucoma O
were O
screened O
for O
glaucoma O
genes: O
myocilin O
(MYOC), O
optineurin O
(OPTN) O
and O
CYP1B1. O
Using O
direct O
sequencing O
a O

(144 O

resulting O
in O
a O
Q48H B-MUT
substitution O
in O
exon O
1 B-MUT
of O
the O
MYOC O
gene O
was O
observed O
in O
five O
of O
the O
eight O
glaucoma O
patients, O
but O
not O
in O
unaffected O
family O
members O
and O
100 O
unrelated O
controls. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
We O
have O
confirmed O
the O
localization O
of O
the O
congenital O
microcoria O
locus O
(MCOR) O
to O
13q31-q32 O
in O
a O
large O
Asian O
Indian O
family O
and O
conclude O
that O
current O
information O
suggests O
this O
is O
a O
single O
locus O
disorder O
and O
genetically O
homogeneous. O
When O
combined O
with O
the O
initial O
linkage O
paper O
our O
haplotype O
and O
linkage O
data O
map O
the O
MCOR O
locus O
to O
a O
6-7 O
cM O
region O
between O
D13S265 O
and O
D13S1280. O
The O
DCT O
locus, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
tyrosinase O
family O
involved O
in O
pigmentation, O
maps O
within O
this O
region. O
Data O
presented O
here O
supports O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
congenital O
microcoria O
is O
a O
potential O
risk O
factor O
for O
glaucoma, O
although O
this O
observation O
is O
complicated O
by O
the O
partial O
segregation O

MYOC O
Q48H B-MUT
(1q24.3-q25.2), O
a O
mutation O
known O
to O
be O
associated O
with O

in O
India. O
Fine O
mapping O

candidate O
gene O
analysis O
continues O
with O
the O
hope O
that O
characterizing O
the O
micocoria O
gene O
will O
lead O
to O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
microcoria O
and O
glaucoma O
causation. O
The O
relationship O
between O
microcoria, O

is O
thought O
to O
play O
a I-MUT
role O
in O
insulin O

the O

we O

The O

No O

The O

In O

We O
sequenced O
the O

BACKGROUND: O
A O
family O
history O
of O
coronary O

disease O
(CHD) O
is O
a O
strong O
risk O
marker O
for O
the O
disease, O
independently O
of O
classical O
risk O
factors. O
It O
could O
be O
decoded O
by O
recognizing O
the O
polymorphisms O
associated O
with O
increased O
risk. O
Renin-angiotensin O
system O
genes O
are O
candidate O
genes O
in O
CHD O
and O
the O
deletion O
allele O
of O
the O
angiotensin O
converting O
enzyme O
(ACE) O
has O
been O
reported O
as O
deleterious. O
However, O
there O
is O
disagreement O
as O
to O
the O
role O
of O
the O
insertion/deletion O
polymorphism O
of O
the O
ACE O
gene O
in O
coronary O
risk. O
AIM: O
To O
evaluate O
whether O
ACE O

constitute O
a O
CHD O

RESULTS: O
The O

and O
28.1%, O
55.2% O

CONCLUSIONS: O
This O

In O

BACKGROUND: O
Recent O
data O
has O
suggested O
that O
polymorphisms O
in O
the O
prostate O
specific O
antigen O
(PSA) O
may O
increase O
prostate O
cancer O
(PC) O
risk. O
The O
PSA O
gene O
contains O
a O
G/A B-MUT
substitution O
in O
the O
androgen O
response O
element O
(ARE) O
1 O
region. O
The O
androgen O
receptor O
(AR) O
gene O
has O
polymorphic O
regions O
containing O
variable O
length O
glutamine O
and O
glycine O
repeats O
and O
these O
are O
believed O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
PC O
risk. O
The O
effect O
on O
PC O
risks O
from O
PSA O
polymorphisms O
alone O
and O
synergistically O
with O
the O
AR O
gene O
was O
examined O
in O
this O
report. O
METHODS: O
One O
hundred O
PC O
patients O
and O
an O
age O
matched O
cohort O
of O
79 O
benign O
prostate O
hyperplasia O
and O
67 O
population O
controls O
were O
entered O
in O
this O
study. O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
blood O
and O
PSA/ARE O
promoter O
region O
amplified O
by O
PCR. O
PCR O
products O
were O
cut O
with O
Nhe O

to O
distinguish O
G/A B-MUT
alleles. O
AR/CAG O
and O
GGC O
repeat O
length O
was O
detected O
by O
automated O
fluorescence O
from O
PCR O
products. O
RESULTS: O
We O
found O
a O
significantly O
higher O
PSA/GG O
distribution O
in O
PC O
(30%) O
than O
either O
benign O
prostatic O
hyperplasia O
(BPH) O
(18%) O
or O
population O
controls O
(16%) O
(P O
= O
0.025). O
Furthermore O
the O
GG O
distribution O
within O
cases O
was O
even O
greater O
in O
younger O
men O
(< O
65 O
years; O
42%; O
P O
= O
0.012). O
Additionally, O
when O
PSA O
genotype O
was O
cross O
classified O
with O
CAG O
repeat, O
significantly O
more O
cases O
than O
both O
BPH O
and O

were O
observed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
(< O
22) O
CAG/GG O
genotype O
(P O
= O
0.006). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
PSA/ARE O
GG O
genotype O
confers O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
PC O
especially O
among O
younger O
men. O
Moreover, O
we O
confirm O
previous O
results O
that O
a O
short O
glutamine O
repeat O
in O
conjunction O
with O
GG O
genotype O
significantly O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
malignant O
disease. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
genetic O

A O

vesicoureteral O

implications O
for O

BACKGROUND: O
Primary O
vesicoureteral O
reflux O
(VUR) O
is O
a I-MUT
hereditary O
disorder O
characterized O
by O
the O
retrograde O
flow O
of O
urine O
into O
the O
ureters O
and O
kidneys. O
It O
affects O
about O
1% O
of O
the O
young O
children O
and O
is O
thus O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
hereditary O
diseases. O
Its O
associated O
nephropathy O
is O
an O
important O
cause O
of O
end-stage O
renal O
failure O
in O
children O
and O
adults. O
Recent O
studies O
indicate O
that O
genetic O
ablation O
of O
mouse O
uroplakin O
(UP) O
III O
gene, O
which O
encodes O
a I-MUT
47 O
kD O
urothelial-specific O
integral O
membrane O
protein O
forming O
urothelial O
plaques, O
causes O
VUR O
and O
hydronephrosis. O
METHODS: O
To O
begin O
to O
determine O
whether O
mutations O
in O
UP O
genes O
might O
play O
a I-MUT
role O
in O
human O
VUR, O
we O
genotyped O
all O
four O
UP O
genes O
in O
76 O
patients O
with O
radiologically O

primary O
VUR O

of O
all O
their O
exons O
plus O
50 O

150 O
bp O
of O
flanking O
intronic O
sequences. O
RESULTS: O
Eighteen O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
were O
identified, O
seven O
of O
which O
were O
missense, O
with O
no O
truncation O
or O
frame O
shift O
mutations. O
Since O
healthy O
relatives O
of O
the O
VUR O
probands O
are O
not O
reliable O
negative O
controls O
for O
VUR, O
we O
used O
a I-MUT
population O
of O
90 O
race-matched, O
healthy O
individuals, O
unrelated O
to O
the O
VUR O
patients, O
as O
controls O
to O
perform O
an O
association O
study. O
Most O
of O
the O
SNPs O
were O
not O
found O
to O
be O
significantly O
associated O
with O
VUR. O
However, O
SNP1 O
of O
UP O

gene O
affecting O
a I-MUT
C O

of O
UP O

a I-MUT
C O
to O
G O

and O
a I-MUT
Pro154Ala B-MUT
change, O
were O
marginally O
associated O
with O
VUR O
(both O
P= O
0.08). O
Studies O
of O
additional O
cases O
yielded O
a I-MUT
second O
set O
of O
data O
that, O
in O
combination O
with O
the O
first O
set, O
confirmed O
a I-MUT
weak O
association O
of O
UP O
III O
SNP7 O
in O
VUR O
(P= O
0.036 O
adjusted O
for O
both O
subsets O
of O
cases O
vs. O
controls). O
CONCLUSION: O
Such O
a I-MUT
weak O
association O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
families O
with O
simple O
dominant O
Mendelian O
inheritance O
suggest O
that O
missense O
changes O
of O
uroplakin O
genes O
cannot O
play O
a I-MUT
dominant O
role O
in O
causing O
VUR O
in O
humans, O
although O
they O
may O
be O
weak O
risk O
factors O
contributing O
to O
a I-MUT
complex O
polygenic O
disease. O
The O
fact O
that O
no O
truncation O
or O

mutations O
have O
been O
found O
in O
any O
of O
the O
VUR O
patients, O
coupled O
with O
our O
recent O
finding O
that O
some O

mice O
yield O
litters O
that O
show O
not O
only O
VUR, O
but O
also O
severe O
hydronephrosis O
and O
neonatal O
death, O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
major O
uroplakin O
mutations O
could O
be O
embryonically O
or O
postnatally O
lethal O
in O
humans. O

Evaluation O
of O
the O
Lys198Asn B-MUT
and O
-134delA B-MUT
genetic O
polymorphisms O
of O
the O
endothelin-1 O

Endothelin-1 O
(ET-1) O
is O
a O
potent O
vasoconstrictor O
and O
shows O
various O
pharmacological O
responses. O
Two O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
in O
the O
ET-1 O
gene O
(EDN1) O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
blood O

(BP). O
One O
is O
the O
Lys198Asn B-MUT
polymorphism, O
which O
showed O
a O
positive O
association O
with O
BP O
in O
overweight O
people. O
Another O
is O
the O
3A/4A O
polymorphism O
(-134delA) O
located O
in O
the O
5'-untranslated O
region. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
Lys198Asn B-MUT
polymorphism O
in O
ET-1 O
in O

as O
well O
as O
the O
association O
between O
either O
of O
the O
two O
polymorphisms O
and O
the O
plasma O
ET-1 O
level. O
We O
expressed O
both O
the O
major O
(Lys-type) O
and O
minor O
type O
(Asn-type) O
preproET-1 O
in O
three O
different O
cell O
lines, O
and O
measured O
the O
levels O
of O
ET-1 O
and O
big O
ET-1 O
in O
the O
culture O
supernatant. O
There O
was O
no O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
levels O
of O
ET-1 O
or O
big O
ET-1 O
between O
the O
Asn-type O
and O
Lys-type O
transfectant. O
In O
the O

study, O
the O

of O
ET-1 O
in O
54 O
hypertensive O
patients O
having O
an O
amino O
acid O
substitution O
from O
Lys B-MUT
to O
Asn I-MUT
at O
position O
198 I-MUT
were O
not O
different O
from O
those O
of O
hypertensives O
without O
the O
substitution. O
However, O
we O
found O
a O
significant O
difference O
in O
ET-1 O
levels O
between O
individuals O
with O
the O
3A/3A O
and O
3A/4A O
genotypes. O
Our O
transient O
expression O
study O
indicates O
that O
the O
Lys198Asn B-MUT
polymorphism O
may O
not O
directly O
affect O
ET-1 O
and O
big O
ET-1 O
production. O
Another O

in O
the O

may O

for O
the O

or O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
EDN1 O
Lys198Asn B-MUT
polymorphism O
and O
other O
factors O
such O
as O
obesity O
may O
be O

the O

However, O
to O

In O
this O

Desmin-related O

Desmin-related O
myopathies O
(DRMs) O
are O
a O
heterogeneous O
group O
of O
muscle O
disorders, O
morphologically O
defined O
by O
intrasarcoplasmic O
aggregates O
of O
desmin. O
Mutations O
in O
the O
desmin O
and O
the O
alpha-B O
crystallin O
genes O
account O
for O
approximately O
one O
third O
of O
the O
DRM O
cases. O
The O
genetic O
basis O
of O
the O
other O
forms O
remain O
unknown, O
including O
the O
early-onset, O
recessive O
form O
with O
Mallory O
body-like O
inclusions O
(MB-DRMs), O
first O
described O
in O
five O
related O
German O
patients. O
Recently, O
we O
identified O
the O
selenoprotein O
N O
gene O
(SEPN1) O
as O
responsible O
for O
SEPN-related O
myopathy O
(SEPN-RM), O
a O
unique O
early-onset O
myopathy O
formerly O
divided O
in O
two O
different O
nosological O
categories: O
rigid O
spine O
muscular O
dystrophy O
and O
the O
severe O
form O
of O
classical O
multiminicore O
disease. O
The O
finding O
of O
Mallory O
body-like O
inclusions O
in O
two O
cases O
of O
genetically O
documented O
SEPN-RM O
led O
us O
to O
suspect O
a O
relationship O
between O
MB-DRM O
and O
SEPN1. O
In O
the O
original O
MB-DRM O
German O
family, O
we O
demonstrated O
a O
linkage O
of O
the O
disease O
to O
the O
SEPN1 O
locus O
(1p36), O
and O
subsequently O
a O
homozygous O
SEPN1 O
deletion O
(del O
92 I-MUT
nucleotide I-MUT
-19/+73) O
in O
the O
affected O
patients. O
A O
comparative O
reevaluation O
showed O
that O
MB-DRM O
and O
SEPN-RM O
share O
identical O
clinical O
features. O
Therefore, O
we O
propose O
that O
MB-DRM O
should O
be O
categorized O
as O
SEPN-RM. O
These O
findings O
substantiate O
the O
molecular O
heterogeneity O
of O
DRM, O
expand O
the O
morphological O
spectrum O
of O
SEPN-RM, O
and O
implicate O
a O
necessary O
reassessment O
of O
the O

in O
early-onset O
myopathies. O

CRYBA3/A1 O

METHODS: O
Family O

were O
recorded. O
The O

was O
documented O
by O
both O

was O
evaluated O
by O

Lenticular O
phenotyping O
and O

were O
performed O
independently O
with O

was O
performed, O
and O
candidate O
genes O
were O
PCR O
amplified O
and O

RESULTS: O
Affected O
individuals O
had O
a I-MUT

for O
DNA O

D17S1857 O
(lod O

of O
CRYBA3/A1, O

maps O
to O
the O
vicinity, O
revealed O
an O
in-frame O
3-bp O

in O
exon O

(279delGAG). O
This O
mutation O
involved O
a I-MUT

cosegregated O
in O
all O

from O
the O

showed O
that O
cortical O

was O
normal. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
DeltaG91 B-MUT
mutation O
in O
CRYBA3/A1 O
is O
associated O
with O
an O
autosomal O

of O
a O
Taiwanese O

The O

Comparison O
of O
sequential O
cytomegalovirus O

antiviral O
therapy. O
BACKGROUND: O
Long-term O
anti-cytomegalovirus O
(CMV) O
treatments O
in O
immunocompromised O
patients O
are O
hampered O
by O
resistance O
to O
antiviral O
drugs. O
Longitudinal O
changes O
in O
the O

may O
depend O
on O
changes O
in O

and O
the O
complexity O
of O
CMV O
isolates. O
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
evaluate O
longitudinal O
changes O
in O
the O
CMV O
resistance O
genotype O
and O
phenotype O
along O
with O
strain-specific O
variability O
in O
a O
patient O
with O

STUDY O
DESIGN: O
The O
resistance O

genotype O
of O
seven O
CMV O
isolates O
collected O
from O
one O
patient O
during O
a O
2-year O
follow-up O
period O
were O
retrospectively O
analysed. O
In O
parallel, O
we O
used O
glycoprotein O
B O
(gB) O
genotyping, O
and O
a- O
and O
UL10-13-sequence O
analysis O
to O
study O
CMV O
interstrain O

RESULTS: O
The O
patient O
was O
infected O
by O
at O
least O
three O
CMV O
strains O
plus O
variants O
of O
the O
parental O
strains. O
Resistance O
to O
ganciclovir, O
cidofovir O
and O

was O
successively O
detected O
during O
the O
follow-up O
period. O
UL97 O
protein O

changes O
responsible O
for O
resistance O
to O
ganciclovir O
were O
initially O
detected O
at O
residues O
591 O
and O
592, O
and O
then O
at O
position O
594. O
Decreased O
sensitivity O
to O
foscarnet O
coincided O
with O
the O
appearance O
of O
amino O
acid O
substitution O
N495K B-MUT
in O
DNA O
polymerase, O
whereas O
cross-resistance O
to O
ganciclovir O
and O
cidofovir O
was O
due O
to O
the O
L501I B-MUT
substitution. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
CMV O
isolates O
obtained O
from O
our O
patient O
were O
complex O
mixtures O
of O
strains. O
Changes O
in O
resistance O
genotypes O
depended O
on O
resistance O
selective O
pressure O
and O
were O
not O
linked O
to O
interstrain O
variation. O

Germany O
reveals O
11 O
novel O

Acute O
intermittent O
porphyria O
(AIP) O
is O
a I-MUT
very O
rare O
autosomal O
dominant O
disorder O
with O
low O
penetrance. O
Mutations O
in I-MUT
the O
gene O
of O
the O
porphobilinogen O
deaminase O
(PBG-D), O
also O
called O
hydroxymethylbilane O

cause O
a I-MUT
partial O

of O
this O
enzyme O
of O
the O
heme O

Overstimulation O
of O

causes O
clinical O
symptoms. O
Because O
of O
the O
variability O
of O
the O
symptoms, O
diagnosis O
is O
often O
delayed. O
Using O
two O
approaches O
for O
genetic O
analysis, O
first O
in I-MUT
a I-MUT

manner, O
then O
sequencing O
extensive O
parts O

the O

11 O
of O
which O

In O
the O

Since O
the O

RESULTS: O
A O

Many O
of O
the O

exhibited O
the O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
high O

in O
West O

suggests O
that O
it O
is O

Furthermore, O
because O

Nevertheless, O
knowledge O

both O
in I-MUT

The O
aim O
of I-MUT
this O

was O
to O

the O

46 O

The O

A I-MUT

in I-MUT
two O

In O
one O

across O
two O

with O
a I-MUT

75%. O
But O
in I-MUT
the O

however, O
the O

We O

this O

The O

were O
about O

The O

these O

the O

suggested O
an O
autosomal O

(p.F1129X) O
in O
the O

Genotyping O

revealed O
that O
both O

thus O
supporting O
gonadal O

as O
the O

This O

the O

The O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O

can O
include O
severe O

that O

METHODS: O
An O

had O
severe O
congenital O
hypotonia O
and O
hepatomegaly, O
developed O

We O
studied O

biochemically, O
and O
we O
sequenced O
the O
whole O

of O
the O
deoxyguanosine O

RESULTS: O
Muscle O

showed O
subsarcolemmal O

and O
negative O
histochemical O
reaction O
for O
phosphorylase. O
Liver O
biopsy O
specimens O
showed O
micronodular O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
data O
further O
expand O
the O

confirm O
the O
strong O

dual O
role O
in O
the O
detoxification O

Two O

have O
been O
described O
in O
the O
exons O
3 O

4 O
of O
the O

The O

were O
determined O
by O

Logistic O

performed O
to O
calculate O
odds O
ratios O
(ORs), O
confidence O
limits O
(CL) O
and O
to O
control O
for O
possible O
confounders. O
The O
exon O
3 O
polymorphism O
of O
the O
mEH O
gene O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
significantly O
decreased O
risk O
of O
lung O
cancer. O
The O
adjusted O
OR, O

to O
subjects O
with O
the O
Tyr113/Tyr113 O

type, O
for O
the O
His113/His113 O
genotype O
was O
0.38 O
(95% O
CL O
0.20-0.75). O
An O
analysis O
according O
to O
histological O
subtypes O
revealed O
a O
statistically O
significant O
association O
for O
adenocarcinomas; O
the O
adjusted O
OR O
for O
the O
His113/His113 O
genotype O
was O
0.40 O
(95% O
CL O
0.17-0.94). O
In O
contrast, O
no O
relationship O
between O
the O
exon O
4 O
polymorphism O
and O
lung O
cancer O

was O
found. O
The O
adjusted O
OR, O
calculated O
relative O
to O
the O
His139/His139 O
wild O
type, O
was O
for O
the O
Arg139/Arg139 O
genotype O
1.83 O
(0.76-4.44). O
Our O
results O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
genetically O
reduced O
mEH O
activity O
may O
be O
protective O
against O
lung O
cancer. O

was O
identified O
in O
one O

with O
normal O

(i.e., O
XLG O

This O

was O
not O

in O
100 O
control O

and O
was O
considered O
responsible O
for O

the O

Excluding O
Q1169X, O
all O

this O

represented O
novel O
mutations. O
All O
mothers O
were O
found O
to O
be O

was O
confirmed O
to O

Mutation O
analysis O
of O
SLC7A9 O
in O
cystinuria O
patients O
in O
Sweden. O
Cystinuria O
is O
an O
autosomal O
recessive O
disorder O
characterized O
by O
increased O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
cystine O
and O
dibasic O
amino O
acids, O
which O
cause O
recurrent O
stone O
formation O
in O
affected O
individuals. O
Three O
subtypes O
of O
cystinuria O
have O
been O
described O
(type O
I, O
II, O
and O
III): O
type O
I O
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
SLC3A1 O
gene, O
whereas O
nontype O
I O
(II O
and O
III) O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
SLC7A9 O
mutations. O
Of O
the O
53 O
patients O
reported O
in O
our O
previous O
work, O
patients O
that O
showed O
SLC7A9 O
mutations O
in O
single-strand O
conformation O

(SSCP) O
screening O
and/or O
either O
lacked O
or O
showed O
heterozygosity O
for O
SLC3A1 O
mutations O
were O
included O
in O
the O
present O
study. O
The O
entire O
coding O
region O
and O
the O
exon/intron O
boundaries O
of O
the O
SLC7A9 O
gene O
were O
analyzed O
by O
means O
of O
both O
SSCP O
and O
DNA O
sequencing O
in O
16 O
patients, O
all O
but O
one O
of O
which O
were O
clinically O
diagnosed O
as O
homozygous O
cystinurics. O
Three O
novel O
SLC7A9 O
mutations O
were O
identified O
in O
the O
patient O
group: O
two O
missense O
mutations O
(P261L O
and O
V330M), O
and O
one O
single O
base-pair O
deletion O
(1009 O
delA). O
We O
also O
detected O
the O
previously O
reported O
A182T B-MUT
and O
nine O
novel O
polymorphisms O
in O
the O
patients. O
Mutations O
V330M B-MUT
and O
1009delA B-MUT
occurred O
on O
different O
alleles O
in O
one O
individual, O
and O
we O
suggest O
that O
these O
mutations O
cause O
cystinuria O
in O
this O
patient. O
One O
patient O
that O
was O
homozygously O
mutated O
in O
the O
SLC3A1 O
gene O
carried O
the O
third O
novel O
mutation O
(P261L). O
We O
conclude O
that O
SLC3A1 O
is O
still O
the O
major O
disease O
gene O
among O
Swedish O
cystinuria O
patients, O
with O
only O
a O
minor O
contribution O
of O
SLC7A9 O
mutations O
as O
the O
genetic O
basis O
of O
cystinuria. O
The O
absence O
of O
SLC3A1 O
and O
SLC7A9 O
mutations O
in O
a O
substantial O
proportion O
of O
the O
patients O
implies O
that O
mutations O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
genes O
that O
were O
not O
analyzed O
may O
be O
present, O
as O
well O
as O
large O
deletions O
that O
escape O
detection O
by O
the O
methods O
used. O
However, O
our O
results O
raise O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
other, O
as O
yet O
unknown O
genes, O
may O
also O
be O
involved O
in O
cystinuria. O

A O

caused O
by O
three O

In O
1982, O
one O
of O
us O
reported O
a O
cluster O
of O
eight O
individuals O
affected O
by O
spondylocostal O

(SD, O
MIM O
277300) O
in O
four O
nuclear O
families O
indigenous O
to O
a O
village O
from O
eastern O
Switzerland. O
We O
tested O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
molecular O
basis O
for O
this O
cluster O
was O
segregation O
of O
a O
single O
mutation O
in O
the O
DLL3 O
gene, O
recently O
linked O
to O
SD. O
Marker O
haplotypes O
around O
the O
DLL3 O
locus O
contradicted O
this O
hypothesis O
as O
three O
different O
haplotypes O
were O
seen O
in O
affected O
individuals, O
but O
sequence O
analysis O
showed O
that O
three O
unreported O
DLL3 O
mutations O
were O
segregating: O
a O
duplication O
of O
17 O
bp O
in O
exon O
8 I-MUT
(c.1285-1301dup), O
a O
single-nucleotide O
deletion O
in O
exon O
5 I-MUT
(c.615delC), O
and O
a O
R238X B-MUT
nonsense O
mutation O
in O
exon O
6. O
Contrary O
to O
our O
initial O
assumption O
of O
a O
single O
allele O
segregating O
in O
this O
small O
community, O
three O
different O
pathogenic O
alleles O
were O
observed, O
with O
a O
putative O
founder O
mutation O
occurring O
at O
the O
homozygous O
state O
but O
also O
compounding O
with, O
and O
thus O
revealing, O
two O
other O
independent O
mutations. O
As O
all O
three O
mutations O
predict O
truncation O
of O
the O
DLL3 O
protein O
and O
loss O
of O
the O
membrane-attaching O
domain, O
the O
results O
confirm O
that O
autosomal O

spondylocostal O
dysostosis O
represents O
the O
null O
phenotype O

A O
"null O

responsible O
for O
erythropoietic O

in O
an O
Israeli O
patient O

parameters. O
Mutations O
in O
the O
human O
ferrochelatase O
gene O
(FECH) O
are O
the O
primary O
cause O
of O
the O
inborn O
disorder O
erythropoietic O
protoporphyria O
(EPP). O
While O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
EPP O
patients O
exhibit O
only O
photosensitivity, O
a O
small O
percentage O
of O
patients O
(approximately O
2%) O
develop O
liver O
complications O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
cutaneous O

In O
this O
study, O
the O
FECH O
gene O
of O
an O
Israeli O
EPP O
patient O
who O
suffered O
from O
EPP-related O
liver O

was O
sequenced. O
A O
splicing O

IVS10+1, B-MUT
g-->t, O
which O
is O
known O
to O
cause O
the O
deletion O
of O

was O
identified O
in O
the O

patient O
as O
well O
as O
in O
his O
symptomatic O

and O
his O

Like O
the O
other O
12 O
known O
FECH O
mutations O
associated O
with O
liver O
complications, O
IVS10+1, B-MUT
g-->t I-MUT
is O
a O
"null-allele" O

Although O
the O
two O

an O
identical O
genotype O

to O
both O
the O

on O
one O
FECH O

polymorphisms, O
-251G, O
IVS1-23T, O
and O
IVS3-48C B-MUT
on O

the O
sister O
of O
the O
index O
patient O
has O
so O
far O
shown O
no O
signs O
of O

suggesting O
that O
additional O

A I-MUT
novel O

heterozygous O
mutation O
in O
the O
CYP17 O
(P450 O
17alpha-hydroxylase) O
gene O
leading O
to O
17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase O

Mutations O
in O
the O
CYP17 O
gene O
impair O
steroid O
biosynthesis O
in O
the O
adrenals O

gonads O
and O
often O
cause O

leading O
to O
amenorrhea, O
sexual O

Several O
CYP17 O
mutations O
resulting O
in O
17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase O

have O
been O
reported O
previously. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
found O
a I-MUT
novel O
CYP17 O
mutation O
from O
the O
molecular O
analysis O
of O
a I-MUT
Korean O
patient O
with O
primary O

with O
a I-MUT
46,XX O

We O
sequenced O
all O
8 O
exons O
of O
the O
CYP17 O
gene O
that O
were O
amplified O
from O
patient's O
genomic O
DNA O
using O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR) O
and O
found O
a I-MUT
compound O
heterozygous O
mutation O
in O
the O
CYP17 O
structural O
gene; O
a I-MUT
1-base O

and O
a I-MUT
1-base O
transversion O
(TAC-->AA) B-MUT
at I-MUT
codon I-MUT
329, O
leading O
to O
the O
production O
of O
a I-MUT
truncated O
protein O
(1-417 O
amino O
acids), O
and O
a I-MUT
3-base O
deletion O
(TCC, O
either O
350-351 O
or O

in O
the O
other O

Restriction O
enzyme O
digestion O
analysis O
of O
patient's O
and O
parental O
DNA O
showed O
that O
the O
1-base O
deletion O
and O
the O
3-base O

are O
inherited O
from O

respectively. O
Here O
we O
conclude O
that O
these O
novel O

account O
for O
the O

Interestingly O
this O

Here, O
by O

We O
then O
generated O

where O
DACH1 O

could O
be O
activated O
by O

(U87-DACH1-high), O
compared O
with O
DACH1-nonexpressing O
U87TR-Da O

(U87-DACH1-low). O
U87-DACH1-low O
cells O
form O
spheroids O
with O
CD133 O
and O
Nestin O

in O
serum-free O

but O
U87-DACH1-high O

not. O
Compared O
with O
spheroid-forming O
U87-DACH1-low O
cells, O
adherent O
U87-DACH1-high O
cells O
display O
lower O
tumorigenicity, O
indicating O
DACH1 O
decreases O
the O
number O
of O
tumor-initiating O
cells. O
Gene O
expression O
analysis O
and O
chromatin O
immunoprecipitation O
assay O
reveal O
that O
fibroblast O
growth O
factor O
2 O
(FGF2/bFGF) O
is O
transcriptionally O
repressed O
by O
DACH1, O
especially O
in O
cells O
cultured O
in O
serum-free O
medium. O
Exogenous O
bFGF O
rescues O
spheroid-forming O
activity O
and O
tumorigenicity O
of O
the O
U87-DACH1-high O
cells, O
suggesting O
that O
loss O
of O
DACH1 O
increases O
the O
number O
of O
tumor-initiating O
cells O
through O
transcriptional O
activation O
of O
bFGF. O
These O
results O
illustrate O
that O
DACH1 O
is O
a O
distinctive O
tumor O
suppressor, O
which O
does O
not O
only O
suppress O
growth O
of O
tumor O

but O
also O
regulates O
bFGF-mediated O
tumor-initiating O

Both O
sporadic O

BCCs O
are O
associated O
with O

OBJECTIVES: O
To O

RESULTS: O
Only O
D9S180, O
of O
six O
microsatellites, O
showed O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
in O
three O
BCCs O
(two O

METHODS: O
We O
investigated O
a O
cohort O
of O
MEN2-related O
patients O
referred O
to O
Tygerberg O
Hospital, O

Cape O
(2003-2009). O
The O
study O
cohort O
was O
divided O
into O
three O

based O
on O

(viz. O
MEN/MTC, O

RESULTS: O
We O
screened O
40 O

Three O
ethnic O

were O
represented O
(white O

among O
whom O

On O
genetic O

an O
RET O
point O
mutation O
at O
the O
high-risk O
634 O

was O
identified O
in O
11 O
cases. O
A O
further O

was O
related O
to O
MEN2 O
in O
3 I-MUT

Other O
less-recognised O

were O
detected O
throughout O
the O

in O
70% O
of O
cases O
and O
included O
the O

CONCLUSION: O
RET O
gene O
mutation O
carries O
a O
risk O
of O
MEN2 O
and O
MTC O
in O
all O
ethnic O
groups O
in O
South O

Prophylactic O

is O
important O
to O
identify O
and O
treat O
high-risk O
patients. O

Autosomal O

in O
the O

in O
a O

with O
anemia, O

and O
CKD. O
Homozygous O
or O
compound O
heterozygous O
mutations O
in O
renin O
(REN) O
cause O
renal O
tubular O
dysgenesis, O
which O
is O
characterized O
by O
death O
in O

due O
to O
kidney O

and O
pulmonary O

The O

the O

caused O
by O
angiotensin-converting O
enzyme O

or O

during O

Recently, O
heterozygous O
REN O
mutations O
were O
shown O
to O
result O
in O
early-onset O
hyperuricemia, O
anemia, O
and O
chronic O
kidney O
disease O
(CKD). O
To O
date, O
only O
3 O
different O
heterozygous O
REN O
mutations O
have O
been O
published. O
We O
report O
mutation O
analysis O
of O
the O
REN O
gene O
in O
39 O
kindreds O
with O

and O
CKD O
who O
previously O
tested O
negative O
for O
mutations O
in O
the O
UMOD O
(uromodulin) O
and O
HNF1B O
(hepatocyte O
nuclear O
factor O
1b) O
genes. O
We O
identified O
one O
kindred O
with O
a O
novel O
thymidine O
to O
cytosine O
mutation O
at O
position O
28 I-MUT
in O
the O
REN O
complementary O
DNA, O
corresponding O
to O
a O
tryptophan O
to O
arginine O

at O
amino O
acid O
10, O
which O
is O
found O
within O
the O
signal O
sequence O
(c.28T>C; O
p.W10R). O
On O
this O
basis, O
we O
conclude O
that O
REN O
mutations O
are O
rare O
events O
in O
patients O
with O
CKD. O
Within O
the O
kindred, O
we O
found O
affected O
individuals O
over O
4 O
generations O
who O
carried O
the O
novel O
REN O
mutation O
and O
were O
characterized O
by O
significant O
anemia, O
hyperuricemia, O
and O
CKD. O
Anemia O
was O
severe O
and O
disproportional O
to O
the O
degree O
of O
decreased O
kidney O
function. O
Because O
all O
heterozygous O
REN O
mutations O
that O
have O
been O
described O
are O
localized O
in O
the O
signal O
sequence, O
screening O
of O
the O
REN O
gene O
for O
patients O
with O
CKD O
with O
hyperuricemia O
and O
anemia O
may O
best O
be O
focused O
on O
sequencing O
of O
exon O

Seven O
strains O

are O
defined O
based O
on O
C-terminal O
sequence O
variations O
of O
the O
latent O

protein O
1 O
(LMP1). O
Some O
strains, O
especially O
those O
with O
a O
30-bp O
deletion, O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
related O
to O
tumorigenic O
activity O
and O
geographical O
localization. O
The O
aims O
of O
the O
study O
were O
to O
determine O
the O
prevalence O
of O
different O
LMP1 O
strains O
and O
to O
investigate O
sequence O

in O
the O
C-terminal O
region O
of O
LMP1 O
in O
Serbian O
isolates. O
This O
study O
included O
53 O
EBV-DNA-positive O
plasma O
and O
tissue O
block O
samples O
from O
patients O
with O
mononucleosis O
syndrome, O
renal O

and O
tumors, O
mostly O
nasopharyngeal O
carcinoma. O
The O
sequence O
of O
the O
506-bp O

of O
LMP1 O
C O
terminus O
was O
used O
for O
phylogenetic O
analyses O
and O
identification O
of O
LMP1 O
strains, O
deletions, O
and O

The O
majority O
of O
isolates O
were O
non-deleted O
(66%), O
and O
the O
rest O
had O
30-bp, O
rare O
69-bp, O
or O
yet O
unknown O
27-bp O
deletions, O
which O
were O
not O
related O
to O
malignant O
or O
non-malignant O

origin. O
However, O
the O
majority O
of O
69-bp O
deletion O
isolates O
were O
derived O
from O
patients O
with O
nasopharyngeal O
carcinoma. O
Less O
than O
five O
33-bp O
repeats O
were O
found O
in O
the O
majority O
of O
non-deleted O
isolates O
(68.6%), O
whereas O
most O
69-bp O
deletion O
isolates O
(75%) O
had O
five O
or O
six O
repeats. O
Serbian O
isolates O
were O
assigned O
to O
four O
LMP1 O
strains: O
B95-8 O
(32.1%), O
China O
1 O
(24.5%), O
North O
Carolina O
(NC; O
18.9%), O
and O
Mediterranean O
(Med; O
24.5%). O
In O
NC O
isolates, O
three O
new O
mutations O
unique O
for O
this O
strain O
were O
identified. O
EBV O
EBNA2 O
genotypes O
1 O
and O
2 O
were O
both O
found, O
with O
dominance O
of O

1 O
(90.7%). O
This O

in O
the O

that O
catalyzes O
the O

More O
than O
70 O
mutations O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
SLS O
patients, O
including O
small O

We O
now O
describe O
2 O
SLS O
patients O
whose O
disease O
is O
caused O
by O
large O
contiguous O
gene O
deletions O
of O
the O
ALDH3A2 O
locus O
on O
17p11.2. O
The O
deletions O
were O
defined O
using O
long O
distance O
inverse O
PCR O
and O
microarray-based O
comparative O
genomic O
hybridization. O
A O
24-year-old O
SLS O
female O
was O
homozygous O
for O
a O
352-kb O
deletion O
involving O
ALDH3A2 O
and O
4 I-MUT
contiguous O
genes O
including O
ALDH3A1, O
which O
codes O
for O
the O
major O

in O
cornea. O
Although O
lacking O
corneal O
disease, O
she O
showed O
severe O
symptoms O
of O
SLS O
with O
uncommon O
deterioration O
in O
oral O
motor O

The O
other O
19-month-old O
female O
patient O
was O
a O
compound O
heterozygote O
for O
a O
1.44-Mb O
contiguous O
gene O
deletion O
and O
a O
missense O
mutation O
(c.407C>T, O
P136L) O
in O
ALDH3A2. O
These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
large O
gene O
deletions O
may O
account O
for O
up O
to O
5% O
of O
the O
mutant O

in O
SLS. O
Geneticists O
should O
consider O
the O
possibility O
of O

heterozygosity O
for O
large O

in O
patients O
with O

in O
five O
patients O
from O
three O

RESULTS: O
We O
detected O
three O

RESULTS: O
Compared O

Primary O

(OMIM O

is O
a O
rare O
hereditary O
disease O
that O
causes O
a O
generalized O
partial O
insensitivity O
to O

action, O
due O
to O
genetic O
alterations O
of O
the O
glucocorticoid O

Investigation O
of O

led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
family O
(eight O

spanning O
three O
generations), O
prone O
to O
cortisol O

bilateral O

This O

exacerbated O
over O

cosegregates O
with O
the O
first O
heterozygous O

mutation O
p.R469[R,X] B-MUT
reported O

for O
the O
GR, O

469 I-MUT
in O
the O
second O
zinc O
finger O
of O
the O
DNA-binding O

of O
the O

In O

this O
mutation O
leads O
to O
a O
truncated O
50-kDa O
GR O
lacking O
hormone O
and O
DNA O
binding O
capacity, O
devoid O
of O
hormone-dependent O
nuclear O

and O

properties. O
In O
the O
proband's O
fibroblasts, O
we O
provided O
evidence O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
expression O
of O
the O
defective O

in O

The O
absence O
of O

GR O
mRNA O
was O
accompanied O
by O
a O
50% O
reduction O
in O
wild O
type O
GR O
transcript O
and O
protein. O
This O
reduced O
GR O
expression O
leads O
to O
a O
significantly O
below-normal O
induction O
of O
glucocorticoid-induced O
target O
genes, O
FKBP5 O
in O
fibroblasts. O
We O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
of O
glucocorticoid O

involved O
GR O
haploinsufficiency O
due O
to O
the O
selective O
degradation O
of O
the O

transcript O
through O
a O
nonsense-mediated O
mRNA O
Decay O
that O
was O
experimentally O
validated O
on O
emetine-treated O
propositus' O
fibroblasts. O
GR O
haploinsufficiency O
leads O
to O
hypertension O
due O
to O
illicit O
occupation O
of O
renal O
mineralocorticoid O
receptor O
by O
elevated O
cortisol O
rather O
than O
to O
increased O
mineralocorticoid O
production O
reported O
in O
primary O
glucocorticoid O
resistance. O
Indeed, O
apparent O
mineralocorticoid O
excess O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
a O
decrease O
in O
urinary O
tetrahydrocortisone-tetrahydrocortisol O
ratio O
in O
affected O
patients, O
revealing O
reduced O
glucocorticoid O
degradation O
by O
renal O
activity O
of O
the O
11b-hydroxysteroid O

type O
2, O
a O
GR O
regulated O
gene. O
We O
propose O
thus O
that O
GR O
haploinsufficiency O
compromises O
glucocorticoid O
sensitivity O
and O
may O
represent O
a O
novel O
genetic O
cause O
of O
subclinical O
hypercortisolism, O
incidentally O
revealed O
bilateral O

and O
mineralocorticoid-independent O

CONCLUSIONS: O
In O

was O
performed O
in O
29 O
patients O

46,XY O
DSD, O
by O
PCR-SSCP. O
The O
amplicons O
that O
showed O
an O

in O
SSCP O
were O
subjected O
to O

Interestingly, O
six O
patients O
from O
4 I-MUT
unrelated O
families O
(a O

of O
sibs, O
uncle/nephew O
and O
other O
two O

In O
five O
patients O
p.R246Q B-MUT
missense O

was O
detected, O
of O
which O
four O
were O

In O
conclusion, O
our O

is O
common O
amongst O
patients O

which O
enables O
simple, O
rapid, O

We O
established O
a O
hrMCA O

using O
genomic O

were O
designed O
to O
cover O
all O

We O
used O
15 O

The O
eight O

were O
all O
successfully O

In O
addition, O
we O
identified O
five O

including O
one O

(c.2992C>T) O
that O

The O
use O
of O

is O
a O
type O
I O

Using O
a O

we O
have O

We O
defined O
manifesting O

excluding O
those O
with O
only O
myalgias/cramps. O
DNA O
extracted O

Among O
these O

varied O
from O
a O

Eight O
had O
exonic O

One O

consistent O
with O
a O

The O
X-chromosome O

was O
skewed O
toward O
non-random O
in O
four O

We O

METHOD: O
Serum O

RESULTS: O
The O

Only O
a O

however. O
The O

OBJECTIVES O
AND O
METHODS: O
To O
examine O
TRPV4 O
mutation O

and O
phenotype-genotype O

we O
searched O
for O
TRPV4 O
mutations O
by O
PCR-direct O

DNA O
in O
22 O

RESULTS: O
TRPV4 O
mutations O
were O
found O
in O
all O

one O
MD O
subject. O
In O
total, O
19 O
different O
heterozygous O

were O
identified O
in O
41 O
subjects; O
two O
were O

In O
MD, O
a O

in O
nine O
subjects, O
as O
well O
as O
10 O
novel O

including O
F471del, O
the O

In O
SMDK, O
a O
recurrent O
R594H B-MUT

was O
identified O

seven O
novel O
mutations. O
An O
association O
between O
the O
position O

was O
also O
observed. O
Thus, O
P799 B-MUT
in O
exon O

is O
a O
hot O

for O
MD O
mutations, O
as O
four O

while O
R594 B-MUT

SMDK O
mutations. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O

however, O
the O

We O
focused O

MAIN O
METHODS: O
Venous O

KEY O
FINDINGS: O
We O
found O
that O
the O

SNP O
was O
associated O
with O
an O

SIGNIFICANCE: O
DISC1 O
Ser704Cys B-MUT
might O
be O
a O
functional O
variant O
that O
affects O
one O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
implicated O
in O
the O
biology O

CFS. O
Some O
patients O
with O
CFS O
showed O
a O
phenotype O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
patients O
with O
MDD, O
but O
further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
clarify O
the O
biological O
mechanism, O
because O
this O
study O
is O
of O
a O
rather O
preliminary O
nature. O
Despite O
the O
variety O
of O
patients O
with O
CFS, O
DISC1 O
Ser704Cys B-MUT
has O
an O
association O
with O
CFS, O
which O
may O
also O
suggest O
that O
DISC1 O
plays O
a O
central O
role O
in O
the O

INTRODUCTION: O
Prostate O

is O
one O
of O
the O

In O
2003, O
6,536 O

The O
renin-angiotensin O

has O
been O
shown O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
prostate O

Two O

with O
the O

both O

reported O
an O

between O

and O
the O

The O
present O
study O
was O
aimed O
at O

for O
an O

Of O

to I-MUT
-225 I-MUT
were O
found O
at I-MUT
different O

the O

Therefore, O
the O
-369, O
-611 B-MUT
and O
-603/604 B-MUT
variations O
were O
considered O
common O
mutations O
in O
this O
population, O
and O
the O
difference O
with O
respect O
to I-MUT
the O
-AAGC B-MUT

was O
not O
significant. O
However, O
the O
A I-MUT

of O
the O
-588 B-MUT
variation O
and O
[+] O
allele O
of O
the O
XmnI O

were O
more O

in O
beta-TI O
patients, O
especially O
those O
who O
had O
the O
IVS-II-1(G>A)/IVS-II-1(G>A) O
genotype. O
The O

allele O
of O
XmnI O
also O
had O
complete O
correlation O
with O
the O
A I-MUT
allele O
of O
-588 B-MUT
variation. O
The O
HS-111 O
(-21 O
A) I-MUT
variation O
also O
showed O
association O
with O
beta-TI O
patients O
who O
had O
high O

F. O
Bearing O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
-588 B-MUT
variation O
lies O
within O
the O
postulated O
adult-specific O
silencer O
region O
and O
that O
the O
majority O
of O

A, O
then O
it O
can O
be O
envisaged O
that O
this O
allele O
could O
have O
a I-MUT
role O
in O
altering O
the O
repressor O
function O
at I-MUT
this O

Therefore, O
the O
A I-MUT
allele O
of O
-588, O
[+] O
allele O
of O
XmnI O
and O
HS-111 O
(-21 O
A) I-MUT

are O
useful O
genetic O
markers O
to I-MUT
differentiate O
between O

However, O
these O

Multiple O
trichoepitheliomas--a O

in O
the O
CYLD O
gene. O
BACKGROUND: O
Trichoepitheliomas O
are O
benign O
neoplasms O
with O
follicular O
differentiation. O
They O
may O
present O
as O
a I-MUT
solitary O
lesion O
or O
as O
multiple O
lesions. O
Multiple O
trichoepitheliomas O
are O
inherited O
in O
an O
autosomal O
dominant O
pattern O
within O
families, O
with O
both O
variable O
penetrance O
and O
expressivity. O
Recent O
investigations O
support O
that O
mutations O
in O
CYLD, O
the O
gene O
affected O
in O
familial O
cylindromatosis O
as O
well O
as O
in O
Brooke-Spiegler O
syndrome, O
are O
also O
responsible O
for O
multiple O
trichoepitheliomas. O
OBJECTIVE: O
The O
authors O
report O
the O
case O
of O
a I-MUT
9-year-old O
African O

with O
multiple O
facial O
trichoepitheliomas O
in O
whom O
a I-MUT

in O
the O
CYLD O

was O
hypothesised. O
MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
After O
genomic O

from O
the O

a I-MUT
molecular O
analysis O
of O
the O
CYLD O

was O
performed O
by O
PCR, O
DHPLC O
and O
automated O
sequencing. O
RESULTS: O
A O
novel O
heterozygous O
mutation O
in O
exon O
18 O
of O
the O
CYLD O
gene O
(c.2449delT) O
was O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O

BACKGROUND: O
Psoriasis O
is O
a O
common O
dermatological O
disorder, O
in O
which O
autoimmunity O
plays O
an O
important O
role. O
CD4(+)CD25(+) O

(T-regs) O
have O
been O
suggested O

involved O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
some O
autoimmune O
diseases. O
T-regs O
express O
the O

factor, O
FOXP3, O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
of O
key O
importance O
in O
the O
development O
and O
function O
of O
T-regs. O
Studies O
have O
found O
that O
single-nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
in O
the O
FOXP3 O
gene O
contribute O
to O
susceptibility O
to O
some O
autoimmune O
disorders. O
However, O
information O
about O
FOXP3 O
gene O
in O

is O
limited. O
OBJECTIVE: O
This O
study O
evaluated O
the O
association O
between O
FOXP3 O
gene O
SNPs O
and O
susceptibility O
to O
psoriasis O
in O
a O
Han O
Chinese O

METHODS: O
In O
a O
hospital-based O

study, O
524 O
patients O
with O
psoriasis O
and O
549 O
psoriasis-free O

We O
investigated O
four O
SNPs O

the O
FOXP3 O
gene O
(-6054, O

The O

RESULTS: O
We O
found O
that O
increased O

was O
associated O
with O
the O
FOXP3 O

and O
the O

1.07-1.78), O
compared O
with O
the O

We O
also O
found O
that O
an O

IVS9+459 B-MUT
GG O
genotype O
(adjusted O
OR, O
2.24; O
95% O

1.41-3.58). O
However, O
the O
combined O
GA+GG O
genotype O
showed O
no O
such O
tendency O
(adjusted O
OR=1.28; O
95% O
CI, O
1.00-1.64), O
compared O
with O
the O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
an O

associated O
with O
the O
FOXP3-6054 O

A/G I-MUT
genotype. O
In O
combined O
genotype O
analyses, O
the O
FOXP3-3279 O
AC+AA O
genotype O
was O
more O
obviously O
associated O
in O
males O
(adjusted O

(PASI O

Meanwhile, O
the O

was O
also O
associated O
with O
severe O

patients O
(adjusted O

CONCLUSIONS: O
FOXP3 O
polymorphisms O
appear O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
risk O
of O

In O

This O

In O
this O

resulting O
in O
residual O
beta-mannosidase O

associated O
with O
severe O
leukoencephalopathy: O
a O
possible O

variant. O
BACKGROUND: O
beta-Mannosidosis O
(OMIM O
248510) O
is I-MUT
a O
rare O
inborn O
lysosomal O
storage O
disorder O
caused O
by O
the O
deficient O
activity O
of O
beta-mannosidase, O
an O
enzyme O
encoded O
by O
a O
single O
gene O
(MANBA) O
located O
on O
chromosome O
4q22-25. O
To O
date, O
only O
20 O
cases O
of O
this O
autosomal O
recessive O
disorder O
have O
been O
described O
and O
14 O
different O
MANBA O
mutations O
were O
incriminated O
in O
the O
disease. O
These O
are O
all O
null O
mutations O
or O
missense O
mutations O
that O
abolish O
beta-mannosidase O
activity. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
characterized O
the O
molecular O
defect O
of O
a O
new O
case O
of O
beta-mannosidosis, O
presenting O
with O
a O
severe O
neurological O
disorder. O
METHODS: O
Genomic O
DNA O
was O
isolated O
from O
peripheral O
blood O
leukocytes O
of O
the O
patient O
to O
allow O
MANBA O
sequencing. O
The O
identified O
mutation O
was O
engineered O
by O
site-directed O
mutagenesis O
and O
the O
mutant O
protein O
was O
expressed O
through O
transient O
transfection O
in O
HEK293T O
cells. O
The O
beta-mannosidase O
expression O
and O
activity O
were O
respectively O
assessed O
by O
Western O

and O
fluorometric O
assay O
in O
both O
leukocytes O
and O

RESULTS: O
A I-MUT
missense O
disease-associated O
mutation, O
c.1922G>A B-MUT
(p.Arg641His), O
was O
identified O
for O
which O
the O
patient O
was O
homozygous. O
In O
contrast O
to O
previously O
described O
missense O
mutations, O
this O
substitution O
does O
not O
totally O
abrogate O
the O
enzyme O
activity O
but O
led O
to O
a O
residual O
activity O
of O
about O
7% O
in O
the O
patient's O
leukocytes, O
11% O
in O

and O
14% O
in O

Expression O
studies O
in O

activity. O
CONCLUSION: O
Correlations O
between O
MANBA O
mutations, O
residual O
activity O
of O
beta-mannosidase O
and O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
ensuing O

PATIENTS O
AND O
METHODS: O
In O
this O

we O
screened O
for O
a O
mutation O
in O
LIX1 O
using O
direct O
DNA O
sequencing O
in O
our O
SMA O
and/or O
SMA-like O

A I-MUT

33 O
patients O
were O
enrolled O
in O
this O
study, O
of O
which O
22 O
were O
Japanese O
and O
11 O
were O
Malaysians. O
All O
these O
patients O
possessed O
at O

two O
copies O
of O
SMN1. O
RESULTS: O
We O
did O
not O
identify O
any O
pathogenic O
mutations O
in O
the O
coding O
regions O
or O
splice O
sites O
of O
LIX1 O
in O
the O
patients. O
In O
addition, O
we O
described O
a O
polymorphism O
within O
LIX1 O

c.387+107A>T. O
We O
found O
that O
A-allele O
is O
significantly O
more O
frequent O
in O

compared O
to O
normal O
individuals. O
CONCLUSION: O
Molecular O
genetic O
analysis O
of O
our O
SMA O

suggests O
that O
LIX1 O
is O
not O

However, O
the O
number O

METHODS: O
We O

We O
also O

RESULTS: O
We O
identified O

The O

the O
matriptase-2 O
(TMPRSS6) O
gene O
of O

The O

is O
the O

the O

the O
four O

that O

The O

Functional O

has O
revealed O
that O
they O
lead O

We O
also O
demonstrate O
that O
the O

Collectively, O
these O
results O
extend O
the O
pattern O
of O
TMPRSS6 O

IRIDA O
and O
functionally O
demonstrate O
that O

We O

in O
Turkish O
asthmatic O

In O
the O

again O
this O

that O
this O
ACE O

may O
be O
a O

BACKGROUND: O
Insulin O
resistance O
is O
a O
core O
feature O
of O
polycystic O
ovary O
syndrome O
(PCOS). O
Phosphatidylinositol O
(PI) O
3-kinase O
is O
an O
important O
enzyme O
in O
the O
early O
insulin O
signaling O
cascade O
and O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
insulin-mediated O
glucose O
transport. O
In O
its O
regulatory O
subunit, O
p85alpha, O
there O
is O
a O
common O
amino O
acid O
substitution O
(the O
Met326Ile B-MUT
polymorphism), O
and O
this O
amino O
acid O
may O
be O
crucial O
for O
the O
function O
of O
the O
p85alpha O
regulatory O
subunit O
and O
PI3-kinase. O
METHODS: O
Analysis O
of O
the O
Met326Ile B-MUT

Clinical O

also O
compared. O
RESULTS: O
The O
genotype O
distribution O
of O
the O
Met326Ile B-MUT
polymorphism O
in O
the O
PCOS O
group O
was O
not O
different O
from O
that O
of O
the O
controls O
(Met326Met/Met326Ile/Ile326Ile O
rates O
were O
73.4%/23.4%/3.2% O

70.3%/26.1%/3.6% O
for O
the O
PCOS O

The O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
PI3-kinase O
gene O
Met326Ile B-MUT

may O
not O
be O
a O
major O

We O
investigated O
a O
region O
of O
repetitive O

of O
the O
von O

factor O
(vWF) O
gene O
(nucleotides O
[nt] O
1639-2404; O
i.e., O
F8VWF). O
We O
identified O
13 I-MUT

and O
33 O
genotypes O
in O
49 I-MUT
unrelated O
Japanese O
individuals. O
The O
heterozygosity O
of O
the O
region O
was O
0.897. O
Direct O
sequence O
analyses O
revealed O
five O
single-base O
substitutions, O
one O
tetranucleotide O
(TTAT) O
insertion, O
and O
seven O
short O
tandem O
repeats O
(STRs) O
in O
the O
intron; O
four O
of O
the O
STRs O
and O
one O
single-base O
substitution O
had O
been O
reported O
previously. O
The O
four O
new O

we O
identified O
were O
1849T>A, O
2122C>T, O
2180C>T, O
and O
2192C>T. O
The O
novel O
TTAT O

was O
inserted O
between O

2057 O
and O
2058. O
The O
three O
newly O
identified O
STRs O
were O
1978(TATC)(1-2), O
2193(ATCT)(5-13), O
and O
2234(TGTA)(5-7). O
The O
five O
single-base O

were O
identified O
only O
with O

but O
frequent O

Using O
a O

in O
36 O
primary O
OSCs, O
we O
identified O
two O
tumors O
with O
apparent O

the O
NF1 O
gene. O
Subsequently, O
18 O
ovarian O
carcinoma-derived O
cell O
lines O
and O
41 O
primary O
OSCs O
were O
evaluated O
for O
NF1 O
alterations. O
Markedly O
reduced O
or O
absent O
expression O
of O
Nf1 O
protein O
was O
observed O
in O
6 O
of O
the O
18 O
cell O
lines, O
and O
using O
the O
protein O
truncation O

and O
sequencing O
of O

genomic O
DNA, O
NF1 O
mutations O
resulting O
in O
deletion O

were O
detected O
in O
5 O
of O
the O
6 O
cell O

with O
loss O
of O

expression. O
Similarly, O
NF1 O
alterations O
including O
homozygous O
deletions O
and O
splicing O
mutations O
were O
identified O
in O
9 O
(22%) O
of O
41 O
primary O
OSCs. O
As O
expected, O
tumors O
and O
cell O
lines O
with O
NF1 O
defects O
lacked O
mutations O
in O
KRAS O
or O
BRAF O
but O
showed O
Ras O
pathway O
activation O
based O
on O
immunohistochemical O
detection O
of O
phosphorylated O
MAPK O
(primary O
tumors) O
or O
increased O
levels O
of O
GTP-bound O
Ras O
(cell O
lines). O
The O
TP53 O
tumor-suppressor O
gene O
was O
mutated O
in O
all O
OSCs O
with O
documented O
NF1 O
mutation, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
pathways O
regulated O
by O
these O
two O
tumor-suppressor O
proteins O
often O
cooperate O
in O
the O
development O
of O

A O

been O
found O
that O

It O
is O
suggested O
that O
this O
polymorphism O
may O
enhance O
susceptibility O

some O
types O

Therefore, O
this O
case-control O
study O
evaluated O
the O
association O
of O
this O
genotype O

with O
susceptibility O
to O
initiation O

For O
this O

whole O

were O
obtained O
from O
150 O
CRC O

100 O
control O
subjects O
in O
Tehran. O
Genomic O
DNA O
was O
extracted O

genotyped O
by O
PCR-RFLP O

We O
showed O
that O
2G O

had O
higher O

in O
patients O
(60% O
and O
39%, O
respectively) O
than O
in O
controls O
(47% O

The O
CRC O
patients O
were O
divided O
into O
two O
groups: O
with O

(M+) O
and O
without O

(M-) O
groups. O
The O
2G O

was O
more O
frequent O
in O

compared O
with O

However, O
no O

(chi(2) O

(TGAG), O
starting O
from O

The O

This O
is O
the O

Is O
the O

allele O
formed O
by O
a I-MUT
breakdown O
of O
the O
pathocenosis O
due O
to O
the O
historical O
Roman O
expansion? O
We O
studied O
the O
possible O
effects O
of O
the O
expansion O
of O
ancient O
Mediterranean O
civilizations O
during O
the O
five O
centuries O
before O
and O
after O
Christ O
on O
the O
European O
distribution O
of O
the O
mutant O
allele O
for O
the O
chemokine O
receptor O
gene O
CCR5 O
which O
has O
a I-MUT
32-bp O
deletion O
(CCR5-Delta32). O
There O
is O
a I-MUT
strong O
evidence O
for O
the O
unitary O
origin O
of O
the O
CCR5-Delta32 O
mutation, O
this O
it O
is O
found O
principally O
in O
Europe O
and O
Western O
Asia, O
with O
generally O
a I-MUT
north-south O
downhill O
cline O
frequency. O
Homozygous O
carriers O
of O
this O
mutation O
show O
a I-MUT
resistance O
to O
HIV-1 O
infection O
and O
a I-MUT
slower O
progression O
towards O
AIDS. O
However, O
HIV O
has O
clearly O
emerged O
too O
recently O
to O
have O
been O
the O
selective O
force O
on O
CCR5. O
Our O
analyses O
showed O
strong O
negative O
correlations O
in O
Europe O
between O
the O
allele O
frequency O
and O
two O
historical O
parameters, O
i.e. O
the O
first O
colonization O
dates O
by O
the O
great O
ancient O
Mediterranean O
civilizations, O
and O
the O
distances O
from O
the O
Northern O
frontiers O
of O
the O
Roman O
Empire O
in O
its O
greatest O
expansion. O
Moreover, O
other O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
deletion O
frequencies O
in O
both O
German O
Bronze O
Age O
and O
Swedish O
Neolithic O
populations O
were O
similar O
to O
those O
found O
in O
the O
corresponding O
modern O
populations, O
and O
this O
deletion O
has O
been O
found O
in O
ancient O
DNA O
of O
around O
7000 O
years O
ago, O
suggesting O
that O
in O
the O
past, O
the O
deletion O
frequency O
could O
have O
been O
relatively O
high O
in O
European O
populations. O
In O
addition, O
in O
West O
Nile O
virus O
pathogenesis, O
CCR5 O
plays O
an O
antimicrobial O
role O
showing O
that O
host O
genetic O
factors O
are O
highly O
pathogen-specific. O
Our O
results O
added O
to O
all O
these O
previous O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
actual O
European O
allele O
frequency O
distribution O
might O
not O
be O
due O
to O
genes O
spreading, O
but O
to O
a I-MUT
negative O
selection O
resulting O
in O
the O
spread O
of O
pathogens O
principally O
during O
Roman O
expansion. O
Indeed, O
as O
gene O
flows O
from O
colonizers O
to O
European O
native O
populations O
were O
extremely O
low, O
the O
mutational O
changes O
might O
be O
associated O
with O
vulnerability O
to O
imported O
infections. O
To O
date, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
parasites O
remains O
unknown; O
however, O
zoonoses O
could O
be O
incriminated. O

was O
developed O
for O
rapid O
identification O

The O
assay O
used O
the O

and O
was O
used O
to O
evaluate O
148 O
clinical O

(97 O

At O
the O

time, O
the O

were O
subjected O
to O
DNA O

and O
conventional O

test. O
One O

one O
(95.3%) O
and O
136 O
(91.9%) O
of O
the O
148 O

assay, O
respectively. O
None O
of O
the O
51 O

Molecular O
and O
clinical O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
SCN5A O
mutation O
associated O
with O
atrioventricular O
block O
and O
dilated O
cardiomyopathy. O
BACKGROUND: O
Increased O
susceptibility O
to O
dilated O
cardiomyopathy O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
patients O
carrying O
mutations O
in O
the O
SCN5A O
gene, O
but O
the O
underlying O
mechanism O
remains O
unclear. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
identified O
and O
characterized, O
both O
in O

and O
clinically, O
an O
SCN5A O
mutation O
associated O
with O
familial O
progressive O
atrioventricular O
block O
of O
adult O
onset O
and O
dilated O
cardiomyopathy O
in O
a O
Chinese O
family. O
METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
Among O
32 O
family O
members, O
5 O
were O
initially O
diagnosed O
with O
atrioventricular O
block O
after O
age O
30; O
4 O
were O
studied, O
3 O
of O
whom O
later O
developed O
dilated O
cardiomyopathy. O
We O
found O
a O
heterozygous O
single-nucleotide O
mutation O
resulting O
in O
an O
amino O
acid O
substitution O
(A1180V) O
in O
all O
studied O
patients O
and O
in O
6 O
other O
younger O
unaffected O
members O
but O
not O
in O
200 O
control O
chromosomes. O
When O
expressed O
with O
the O
beta1 O
subunit, O
the O
mutated O
channels O
exhibited O
a O
-4.5-mV O
shift O
of O
inactivation O
with O
slower O
recovery O
leading O
to O
a O
rate-dependent O
Na(+) O
current O
reduction O
and O
a O
moderate O
increase O
in O
late O
Na(+) O
current. O
Clinical O
study O
revealed O
that O
although O
QRS O
duration O
decreased O
with O
increasing O
heart O
rate O
in O
noncarrier O
family O
members, O
this O
change O
was O
blunted O
in O
unaffected O
carriers O
whose O
ECG O
and O
heart O
function O
were O
normal. O
Resting O
corrected O
QT O
interval O
of O
unaffected O
carriers O
was O
significantly O
longer O
than O
that O
of O
noncarriers, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
still O
within O
the O
normal O
range. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
A1180V B-MUT
expresses O
a O
mild O
Na(+) O
channel O
phenotype O
in O
vitro O
and O
a O
corresponding O
clinical O
phenotype O
in O
unaffected O
mutation O
carriers, O
implying O
that O
A1180V B-MUT
caused O
structural O
heart O
disease O
in O
affected O
carriers O
by O
disturbing O
Na(+) O
influx O
and, O
hence, O
cellular O
Na(+) O
homeostasis. O
The O
high O
penetrance O
of O
A1180V B-MUT
suggests O
this O
phenotype O
as O
a O
high O
risk O
factor O
for O
dilated O
cardiomyopathy O
with O
preceding O
atrioventricular O
block. O

PURPOSE: O
To O
report O
the O
clinical, O
ophthalmic, O
and O
genetic O
characteristics O
for O
lattice O
corneal O
dystrophy O
type O
I O
(LCDI) O
in O
a O
Chilean O
family. O
METHODS: O
Six O
affected O
family O
members O
were O
examined O
clinically O
including O
visual O
acuity, O
color O
cornea O
photography, O
applanation O
tonography, O
and O
fundoscopy. O
Genomic O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
peripheral O
leukocytes O
from O
six O
affected O
and O
three O
unaffected O
members O
of O
a O
family O
with O
lattice O
corneal O
dystrophy O
type O
I. O
Exon O
4 I-MUT
of O
the O
transforming O
growth O
factor-induced O
gene O
(TGFBI) O
was O
screened O
for O
the O
most O
frequent O
mutation, O
R124C, O
in O
the O
proband O
by O
sequencing. O
We O
also O
designed O
a O
rapid O
polymerase O

polymorphism O
(PCR-RFLP) O
method O
to O
analyze O
the O
same O
mutation, O
amplifying O
exon O
4 I-MUT
and O
digesting O
with O
PstI O
restriction O
enzyme. O
Using O
this O
strategy, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
mutation O
in O
six O
affected O
and O
three O
healthy O
family O
members. O
RESULTS: O
Three O
generations O
of O
family O
members O
were O
positively O
diagnosed O
with O
lattice O
corneal O
dystrophy. O
Six O
participants O
demonstrated O
LCD1 O
in O
both O
eyes, O
most O
of O
whom O
were O
symmetric. O
Age O
at O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
was O
variable O
(3-42 O
years O
old). O
Moreover, O
in O
this O
family, O
the O
age O
of O
onset O
of O
the O
disease O
decreased O
in O
succeeding O
generations, O
which O
could O
be O
interpreted O
as O
anticipation. O
Visual O
acuity O
varied O
from O
1.0 O
to O
0.13. O
Two O
patients, O
ages O
69 O
and O
44 O
years O
old, O
demonstrated O
a O
degree O
of O
severity O
"Bad" O
according O
to O
best-corrected O
vision O
and O
corneal O
commitment. O
The O
exon O
4 I-MUT
sequence O
of O
TGFBI O
of O
the O
proband O
exhibits O
the O
heterozygous O
single-nucleotide O
mutation, O
C417T, O
leading O
to O
amino O
acid O
substitution O
(R124C) O
in O
the O
encoded O
TGF-induced O
protein. O
Using O
PCR-RFLP, O
we O
confirmed O
the O
heterozygous O
mutation O
in O
six O
affected O
family O
members O
and O
excluded O
it O
in O
three O
healthy O
members. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
R124C B-MUT
mutation O
in O
TGFBI O
cosegregated O
with O
LCD O
type O
I O
in O
the O
investigated O
family. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
report O
of O
a O
molecular O

of O
LCD O
type O
I O
in O
Chilean O
patients. O
The O
early O

affected O
persons O
in O
the O

OBJECTIVE: O
Aromatase O
cytochrome O

(CYP19) O
is O
a O
key O
enzyme O
in O
estrogen O
biosynthesis, O
and O
polymorphisms O
within O

DESIGN/METHODS: O
We O
performed O
a O

and O
the O
C/T B-MUT

RESULTS: O
Significantly O
increased O

of O
gynecomastia O
was O
found O
in O
subjects O
carrying O
a O
CYP19 O

previously O
related O
to O
the O

We O
found O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
CYP19 O

RESULTS: O
A I-MUT

CONCLUSIONS: O
While O

can O
be O
found O
in O

in O
the O

OBJECTIVES: O
Interferon O
regulatory O
factor O
5 O
(IRF5) O
is O
a O
member O

the O
IRF O
family O
of O

which O
regulate O
the O

Polymorphisms O

but O
their O

Here, O
we O
assessed O
the O
genetic O
role O

IRF5 O
in O
susceptibility O

(RA) O
in O
Japanese O

METHODS: O
We O

polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
and O
a O
CGGGG O
insertion-deletion O

in O
the O

We O
performed O
2 I-MUT

using O
Japanese O
subjects O
(first O
set: O
830 O

658 O
controls; O
second O
set: O
1112 O
patients O
with O

then O
performed O
a O

using O
human O

We O
genotyped O
the O

RESULTS: O
A O
significant O
association O
of O
the O
rs729302 B-MUT
A O

was O
found O
in O

When O
the O

were O
stratified O
by O
the O

the O

A O

In O
both O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
findings O
indicate O
that O
the O
promoter O

of O
IRF5 O
is O
a O
genetic O
factor O
conferring O

Functional O
inactivation O
of O
the O
WTX O
gene O
is O
not O
a O

event O
in O
Wilms' O
tumors. O
For O
many O
years O
the O
precise O
genetic O
etiology O
of O
the O
majority O
of O
Wilms' O
tumors O
has O
remained O
unexplained. O
Recently, O
the O
WTX O
gene, O
mapped O
to O
chromosome O
Xq11.1, O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
lost O
or O
mutated O
in O
approximately O
one-third O
of O
Wilms' O
tumors. O
Moreover, O
in O
female O
cases, O
the O
somatically O
inactivated O
alleles O
were O
found O
to O
invariantly O
derive O
from O
the O
active O
chromosome O
X. O
Consequently, O
WTX O
has O
been O
proposed O
as O
a O
'one-hit' O
tumor O
suppressor O
gene. O
To O
provide O
further O
insights O
on O
the O
contribution O
of O
WTX O
to O
the O
development O
of O
the O
disease, O
we O
have O
examined O
102 O
Wilms' O
tumors, O
obtained O
from O
43 O
male O
and O
57 O
female O
patients. O
Quantitative O
PCR O
analyses O
detected O
WTX O
deletions O
in O
5 O
of O
45 O
(11%) O
tumors O
from O
males, O
whereas O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
at O
WTX-linked O
microsatellites O
was O
observed O
in O
9 O
tumors O
from O
50 O
informative O
females O
(19%). O
However, O
in O
the O
latter O
group, O
using O
a O
combination O
of O
HUMARA O
assay O
and O
bisulfite-modified O
DNA O
sequencing, O
we O
found O
that O
the O
deletion O
affected O
the O
active O
chromosome O
X O
only O
in O
two O
cases O
(4%). O
Sequence O
analyses O
detected O
an O
inactivating O
somatic O
mutation O
of O
WTX O
in O
a O
single O
tumor, O
in O
which O
a O
strongly O
reduced O
expression O
of O
the O
mutant O
allele O
respect O
to O
the O
wild-type O
allele O
was O
observed, O
a O
finding O
not O
consistent O
with O
its O
localization O
on O
the O
active O
chromosome O
X. O
Overall, O
a O
functional O
somatic O
nullizygosity O
of O
the O
WTX O
gene O
was O
ascertained O
only O
in O
seven O
of O
the O
Wilms' O
tumors O
included O
in O
the O
study O
(approximately O
7%). O
Our O
findings O
indicate O
that O
previously O
reported O
estimates O
on O
the O
proportion O
of O
Wilms' O
tumors O
due O
to O
WTX O

Here, O
we O

we O
first O
narrowed O
the O
common O
region O

to O
a O
2.5 O

at O
6q14-15. O
Of O
the O

and O
expressed O
in O

only O
snoRNA O
U50 O

OBJECTIVE: O
Childhood-onset O
systemic O
lupus O
erythematosus O
(SLE) O
presents O
a O
unique O
subgroup O
of O
patients O
for O
genetic O
study. O
The O
present O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
identify O
susceptibility O
genes O
contributing O
to O
SLE, O
using O
a O
novel O
candidate O
gene O
pathway O

platform O
to O
investigate O
gene O
expression O
in O
patients O
with O
childhood-onset O
SLE O
and O
both O
of O
their O

METHODS: O
Utilizing O
bioinformatic O
tools, O
a O
platform O
of O
9,412 O
single-nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
from O
1,204 O
genes O
was O
designed O
and O
validated. O
Molecular O
inversion O

Seven O
hundred O
fifty O
three O
subjects, O
corresponding O
to O
251 O
full O
trios O
of O
childhood-onset O
SLE O
families, O
were O
genotyped O
and O
analyzed O
using O
transmission O
disequilibrium O
testing O
(TDT) O
and O
multitest O
corrections. O
RESULTS: O
Family-based O
TDT O
showed O
a O
significant O
association O
of O
SLE O
with O
a O
N673S B-MUT
polymorphism O
in O
the O
P-selectin O
gene O
(SELP) O
(P O

the O
interleukin-1 O
receptor-associated O
kinase O
1 O
gene O
(IRAK1) O
(P O

These O
2 I-MUT
SNPs O
had O
a O
false O

rate O
for O
multitest O
correction O
of O
<0.05, O
and O
therefore O
a O

Furthermore, O
7 I-MUT
additional O
SNPs O
showed O
q O
values O

<0.5, O
suggesting O
association O
with O
SLE O
and O
providing O
a O

for O
followup O
studies. O
These O
additional O
genes O
notably O
included O
TNFRSF6 O
(Fas) O
and O
IRF5, O
supporting O
previous O
findings O
of O
their O
association O
with O

pathogenesis. O
CONCLUSION: O
SELP O
and O
IRAK1 O
were O
identified O
as O
novel O
SLE-associated O
genes O
with O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
significance, O
suggesting O
new O
directions O
in O
understanding O
the O

a O
novel O
and O
powerful O
approach O
that O
is O

is O
a O
disorder, O
characterized O
by O
increased O
levels O

In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
determined O
the O

of O
the O
eight O
most O

which O
are O
characterized O
by O
unequal O

This O
is O
the O
first O
study O
of O
the O

We O
detected O
15 O
COH1 O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
OBJECTIVE: O
Methylating O

are O
effective O
chemotherapy O
agents O
for O
Hodgkin O
lymphoma, O
but O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O

Cytotoxicity O
of O
methylating O

is O
mediated O
primarily O
by O
the O
DNA O

We O
hypothesised O
that O
a O

substitution O
in O
the O
basal O
promoter O
of O
MLH1 O
(position O
-93, O

modifies O
the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O

support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
common O

at O
position O

in O
the O

defines O
a O
risk O

for O

However, O
replication O
of O
this O

in O

is O
suggested. O

A O
novel O
missense O
mutation O
in O
the O
paired O
domain O
of O
human O
PAX9 O
causes O
oligodontia. O
PAX9 O
and O
MSX1 O
are O
transcription O
factors O
that O
play O
essential O
roles O
in O
craniofacial O
and O
limb O
development. O
In O
humans, O
mutations O
in O
both O
genes O
are O
associated O
with O
nonsyndromic O
and O
syndromic O
oligodontia, O
respectively. O
We O
screened O
one O
family O
with O
nonsyndromic O
oligodontia O
for O
mutations O
in O
PAX9 O
and O
MSX1. O
Single O

conformational O
polymorphism O
(SSCP) O
analysis O
and O
sequencing O
revealed O
a O
novel O
heterozygous O
C139T B-MUT
transition O
in O
PAX9 O
in O
the O
affected O
members O
of O
the O
family. O
There O
were O
no O
mutations O
detected O
in O
the O
entire O
coding O
sequence O
of O
MSX1. O
The O
C139T B-MUT
mutation, O
predicted O
to O
result O
in O
the O
substitution O
of O
an O
arginine O
by O
a O
tryptophan O
(R47W) O
in O
the O
N-terminal O
subdomain, O
affected O
conserved O
residues O
in O
the O
PAX9 O
paired O
domain. O
To O
elucidate O
the O
pathogenic O
mechanism O
producing O
oligodontia O
phenotype O
caused O
by O
this O
mutation, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
binding O
of O
wild-type O
and O
mutant O
PAX9 O
paired O
domain O
protein O
to O
double-stranded O
DNA O
targets. O
The O
R47W B-MUT
mutation O
dramatically O
reduced O
DNA O
binding O
suggesting O
that O
the O
mutant O
protein O
with O
consequent O
haploinsufficiency O
results O
in O
a O
clinical O
phenotype. O

Although O
several O

To O

we O
conducted O

The O

extracted O

was O
fairly O

in O

There O
was O
no O

A O

Among O

OBJECTIVE: O
To O
investigate O
whether O
polymorphisms O
of O
angiotensin O
converting O
enzyme O
gene O
(ACE) O
and O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
type O
1 I-MUT

(AT1R) O
are O
associated O
with O
etiology O
of O

impact O
in O
women O
with O
preeclampsia. O
METHODS: O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
from O
peripheral O
blood O
of O
133 O
patients O
with O
preeclampsia O
and O
105 O
healthy O
pregnant O
women. O
The O
I/D O
polymorphism O
of O
the O
ACE O
gene O
was O
assessed O
by O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction, O
and O
the O
A1166C B-MUT
polymorphism O
of O
the O
AT(1)R O
gene O
was O
additionally O
assessed O
by O
DdeI O
digestion. O
The O
level O
of O
proteinuria, O

creatinine O
and O
uric O
acid O
were O
investigated O
according O
to O
different O
genotypes O
of O
ACE O
and O
AT1R O
genes. O
RESULTS: O
The O
frequency O
of O
genotypes O
of O
the O
ACE O
gene O
and O
the O
AT1R O
gene O
was O
similar O
in O
preeclampsia O
and O
normal O
pregnancy. O
DD O
and O
ID O
genotype O
predominated O
in O
patients O
with O
severe O
proteinuria, O
as O
well O
as O
increased O
serum O
urea O
and O
uric O
acid. O
Serum O
creatinine O
was O
also O
increased, O
but O
no O
significant O
difference O
was O
found O
among O
three O
genotypes. O
The O
level O
of O
proteinuria, O
serum O
uric O
acid, O
urea, O
and O
creatinine O
did O
not O
vary O
between O
different O
AT1R O
genotypes. O
Compared O
with O
patients O
without O
renal O
dysfunction, O
the O
frequency O
of O
DD O
and O
ID O
genotypes O
of O
ACE O
gene O
was O
much O
higher O
in O
those O
with O
renal O
dysfunction, O
but O
AC O
and O
CC O
genotypes O
of O
AT1R O
gene O
were O
not. O
CONCLUSION: O
We O
found O
no O
association O
of O
the O
two O
gene O
polymorphisms O
with O
preeclampsia. O
However, O
ACE O
gene O
I/D O
polymorphisms O
were O
associated O
with O
the O
severe O
proteinuria O
and O
renal O
dysfunction O
seen O
in O
preeclampsia. O
Preeclampsia O
patients O
carrying O
the O
D O
allele O
may O
be O
susceptible O
to O
renal O

Achondroplasia O
is O
the O
most O

has O
an O
incidence O

approximately O
1/7500. O
In O

We O

to O
detect O
both O
the O
c.1138G>A B-MUT

successfully O
distinguish O
DNA O
samples O
that O
are O
homozygous O

for O
the O

reliably O
detect O
one O
copy O
of O
the O

in O
a O

in O
the O

region. O
Gilles O
de O
la O
Tourette O
Syndrome O
(GTS) O
is O
an O
inherited O
neuropsychiatric O
disorder O
characterized O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
motor O
and O
phonic O
tics. O
Previous O
genetic O
studies O
have O
identified O
linkage O
and O
association O
between O
GTS O
and O
the O
11q24 O
chromosomal O
region. O
We O
selected O
for O
study, O
within O
this O
region, O
two O
possible O
susceptibility O
genes O
for O
GTS, O
the O
ROBO3 O
and O
ROBO4 O
genes. O
These O
two O
genes O
were O
selected O
because O
of O
the O
recent O
identification O
of O
SLITRK1 O
as O
a O
potential O
susceptibility O
gene O
for O
GTS O
based O
on O
a O
translocation O
breakpoint O
and O
the O
further O
finding O
of O
two O
mutations O
in O
the O
SLITRK1 O
gene O
in O
three O
patients O
with O
GTS. O
While O
thus O
far, O
the O
SLITRK1 O
gene O
appears O
to O
account O
for O
only O
a O
few O
cases O
of O
GTS, O
these O
findings, O
if O
confirmed, O
point O
to O
other O
genes O
in O
these O
pathways O
that O
may O
contribute O
to O
GTS. O
Based O
on O
this, O
we O
examined O
two O
genes O
in O
the O
Slit-Robo O
pathway O
involved O
in O
cell O
migration, O
axonal O
pathfinding, O
and/or O
neuronal O
differentiation O
because O
of O
their O
location O
in O
11q24, O
a O
region O
previously O
identified O
as O
linked O
and O
associated O
with O
GTS. O
We O
selected O
six O
haplotype O
tagging O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
for O
ROBO3 O
and O
four O
for O
ROBO4 O
and O
genotyped O
them O
in O
our O
sample O
of O
trios O
and O
sibpair O
families O
diagnosed O
with O
GTS. O
Based O
on O
155 O
nuclear O
families O
with O
255 O
affected O
children, O
we O
did O
not O
find O
evidence O
for O
association O
between O
GTS O
and O
either O
the O
ROBO3 O
or O
ROBO4 O
genes. O
Thus, O
these O
two O
genes O
are O
unlikely O
to O
be O
the O
susceptibility O
genes O
contributing O
to O
GTS O
on O
11q24. O

Mutations O

Therefore, O
we O

Eleven O

A I-MUT
novel O
IRF6 O
nonsense O
mutation O
(Y67X) O
in O
a O
German O
family O
with O
Van O
der O
Woude O

Van O
der O
Woude O
syndrome O
(VWS) O
is O
the O
most O
common O
type O
of O
syndromic O
orofacial O
cleft, O
which O
accounts O
for O
approximately O
2% O
of O
all O
cleft O
lip O
and O
palate O
cases. O
It O
is O
characterised O
by O
variable O
association O
of O
lower O
lip O
pits, O
cleft O
lip O
and O
cleft O
palate, O
and O
hypodontia. O
VWS O
arises O
as O
the O
result O
of O
mutations O
in O
the O
gene O
encoding O
interferon O
regulatory O
factor O
6 I-MUT
(IRF6). O
The O
disorder O
is O
transmitted O
in O
an O
autosomal O
dominant O
manner, O
with O
high O
penetrance O
and O
variable O
expressivity. O
Very O
recently, O
mutations O
of O
the O
IRF6 O
gene O
in O
exons O
2-9 O
have O
been O
found O
in O
VWS O
patients, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
gene O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
orofacial O
development. O
We O
report O
a O
novel O
mutation O
of O
the O
IRF6 O
gene O
in O
a O
German O
family. O
Five O
out O
of O
the O
12 O
persons O
affected O
were O
able O
to O
be O
investigated. O
The O
mutation O
produced O
a O
stop O
codon O
within O
exon O
4 O
of O
the O
IRF6 O
gene. O
All O
5 O
patients O
were O
heterozygous O
for O
a O
base O
substitution O
c.201C>A B-MUT
changing O
the O

67 I-MUT
into O
a O

codon O
(p.Y67X) O
in O

The O
premature O

was O
responsible O
for O
a O
truncated O

Subfertility O
in O
mice O
harboring O
a O
mutation O
in O
betaB2-crystallin. O
PURPOSE: O
betaB2-crystallin O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
abundant O
proteins O
of O
the O
adult O
ocular O
lens O
of O
mammals O
although O
it O
is O
expressed O
at O
lower O
levels O
in O
several O
extralenticular O
locations. O
While O
mutations O
in O
betaB2-crystallin O
are O
known O
to O
result O
in O
lens O
opacities, O
alterations O
in O
tissues O
besides O
the O
lens O
have O
not O
been O
previously O
investigated O
in O
these O
mutants. O
Since O
we O
found O
mice O
harboring O
the O
Crybb2Phil O
mutation O
bred O
poorly, O
here O
we O
assess O
the O
contribution O
of O
betaB2-crystallin O
to O
mouse O
fertility O
and O
determine O
the O
expression O
pattern O
of O
betaB2-crystallin O
in O
the O
testis. O
METHODS: O
The O
expression O
pattern O
of O
betaB2-crystallin O
in O
the O
testis O
was O
analyzed O
by O
rt-PCR, O
western O
blotting, O
and O
immunohistochemistry. O
The O
fecundity O
of O
wildtype O
and O
Crybb2Phil O
mice O
was O
analyzed O
by O
quantitative O
fertility O
testing. O
The O
morphology O
of O
testes O
and O
ovaries O
was O
assessed O
by O
hematoxylin O
and O
eosin O
staining. O
RESULTS: O
In O
the O
mouse O
testis, O
betaB2-crystallin O
mRNA O
is O
found O
at O
low O
levels O
at O
birth, O
but O
its O
expression O
upregulates O
in O
this O
tissue O
as O
the O
testis O
is O
primed O
to O
initiate O
spermatogenesis. O
Western O
blotting O
detected O
betaB2-crystallin O
protein O
in O
sperm O
obtained O
from O
mice, O
cattle, O
and O
humans O
while O
immunolocalization O
detected O
this O
protein O
in O
developing O
sperm O
from O
the O
spermatocyte O
stage O
onward. O
Male O
and O
female O
mice O
homozygous O
for O
a O
12 O
nucleotide O
inframe O
deletion O
mutation O
in O
betaB2-crystallin O
are O
subfertile O
when O
analyzed O
on O
a O
Swiss O
Webster O
derived O
background O
due O
to O
defects O
in O
egg O
and O
sperm O
production. O
However, O
mice O
harboring O
the O
same O
mutation O
on O
the O
C57Bl/6 O
genetic O
background O
did O
not O
exhibit O
any O
defects O
in O
reproductive O
function. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
betaB2-crystallin O
is O
expressed O
in O
developing O
and O
mature O
sperm O
and O
mice O
of O
both O
sexes O
harboring O
the O
Philly O
mutation O
in O
the O
betaB2-crystallin O
gene O
are O
subfertile O
when O
analyzed O
on O
a O
Swiss O
Webster O
genetic O
background. O
While O
these O
data O
are O
suggestive O
of O
a O
role O
for O
betaB2-crystallin O
in O
fertility, O
definitive O
determination O
of O
this O
will O
await O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
betaB2-crystallin O
null O
mouse. O

(BM) O
of O

who O
are O

In O
particular, O
an O
isochromosome O
i(7)(q10) O
is O
frequent, O
and O
is O
usually O
monitored O
by O
chromosome O
analyses. O
We O
tested O
an O
approach O
by O
real-time O
quantitative O
polymerase O
chain O

(RQ-PCR) O
on O
a O
chromosome O
7 O

Five O
DNA O
samples O
of O
2 O
Shwachman O
syndrome O
patients O
with O
clonal O
i(7)(q10) O
in O
the O
BM O
were O
used. O
Both O
were O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
diallelic O
indel O
polymorphism O
MID1064, O
which O
maps O
in O
7q35. O
The O
percentage O
of O
i(7)(q10)-positive O
cells O
was O
extrapolated O
from O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
2 O
alleles O
measured O
by O
means O
of O
an O
allele-specific O
RQ-PCR O
assay. O
The O
results O
were O
compared O
with O
cytogenetic O
analyses O
on O
the O
same O
material O
used O
for O
RQ-PCR. O
In O
1 O
patient, O
the O
RQ-PCR O
results O
matched O
well O
with O
those O
of O
chromosome O
analyses, O
whereas O
in O
the O
other O
one O
RQ-PCR O
showed O
that O
around O
40% O
of O
the O
BM O
cells O
were O
abnormal, O
while O
they O
resulted O
to O
be O
nearly O
80% O
with O
conventional O
monitoring O
assays. O
As O
the O
results O
obtained O
by O
RQ-PCR O
refer O
to O
the O
DNA O
of O
around O
128,000 O
BM O
cells, O
our O
method O
proved O
to O
be O
feasible O
and O
more O
efficient O
in O
the O
quantitative O
evaluation O
of O
the O
i(7)(q10)-positive O
clone O
than O
conventional O
ones. O

DFF45/ICAD O
restores O
cisplatin-induced O
nuclear O

not O
DNA O
cleavage O
in O
DFF45-deficient O
neuroblastoma O
cells. O
We O
have O
previously O
defined O
a O
homozygously O
deleted O
region O
at O
chromosome O
1p36.2-p36.3 O
in O
human O
neuroblastoma O
cell O
lines, O
NB-1 O
and O
NB-C201, O
and O
identified O
six O
genes O
including O
DFF45/ICAD O
within O
this O
region. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
found O
that O
NB-C201 O
cells O
are O
much O
more O
resistant O
to O
various O
genotoxic O
stresses O
such O
as O
cisplatin O
(CDDP) O
than O
CHP134 O
and O
SH-SY5Y O
cells O
that O
do O
not O
have O
the O
homozygous O
deletion. O
To O
examine O
a O
role(s) O
of O
DFF45 O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
apoptosis O
in O
response O
to O
CDDP, O
we O
have O
established O
stably O
DFF45-expressing O
NB-C201 O
cell O
clones O
(DFF45-1 O
and O
DFF45-3) O
and O
a O
control O
cell O
clone O
(NB-C201-C) O
using O
a O
retrovirus-mediated O
gene O
transfer. O
In O
contrast O
to O
NB-C201-C O
cells, O
DFF45-3 O
cells O
displayed O
apoptotic O
nuclear O
fragmentation O
in O
response O
to O
CDDP. O
Although O
CDDP-induced O
proteolytic O
cleavage O
of O
procaspase-3 O
and O
DFF45 O
in O
DFF45-3 O
cells, O
we O
could O
not O
detect O
a O
typical O
apoptotic O
DNA O
fragmentation. O
Additionally, O
deletion O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
C-terminal O
region O
of O
DFF45 O
is O
required O
for O
inducing O
nuclear O
fragmentation. O
Unexpectedly, O
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium O
bromide O
(MTT) O
assays O
demonstrated O
that O
DFF45 O
has O
undetectable O
effect O
on O
CDDP O
sensitivity O
of O
NB-C201 O
cells. O
Taken O
together, O
our O
present O
results O
suggest O
that O
DFF45/DFF40 O
system O
may O
be O
sufficient O
for O
CDDP-induced O
nuclear O
fragmentation O
but O
not O
DNA O
cleavage. O

In O
the O

we O
report O
the O
first O
systematic O

of O
the O

We O
analyzed O
the O
nucleotidic O

in I-MUT
DNA O
samples O
from O
90 O
French O
Caucasians O

and O
46 O
control O
individuals, O
using O
single-strand O

of O

(PCR-SSCP). O
We O
identified O
24 O
novel O
mutations O
distributed O
in I-MUT
the O

region O
of O
the O
gene, O
as O
well O
as O
in I-MUT
the O

In O

CYP2F1*2A, O

were O

The O
most O

CYP2F1*2A O
(25.6%), O
harbors O
a O
combination O
of O
9 O
mutations, O
including O

(c.14_15insC) O
that O

probably O
leading O
to O
the O
synthesis O
of O
a O

The O
identification O
of O
around O
7% O
of O
homozygotes O
for O
the O

in I-MUT
our O
Caucasian O

suggests O
the O
existence O

the O

However, O
our O

Human O
TBX1 O
missense O
mutations O
cause O
gain O
of O

resulting O
in O
the O

phenotype O
as O
22q11.2 O

Deletion O
22q11.2 O
syndrome O
is O
the O
most O
frequent O
known O
microdeletion O
syndrome O
and O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
highly O
variable O
phenotype, O
including O
DiGeorge O
and O
Shprintzen O
(velocardiofacial) O
syndromes. O
Although O
haploinsufficiency O
of O
the O
T-box O
transcription O
factor O
gene O
TBX1 O
is O
thought O
to O
cause O
the O
phenotype, O
to O
date, O
only O
four O

in O
TBX1 O
have O
been O
reported O
in O
association O
with O
six O
of O
the O
major O
features O
of O
22q11.2 O
deletion O
syndrome. O
Although, O
for O
the O
two O
truncating O
mutations, O
loss O
of O
function O
was O
previously O
shown, O
the O
pathomechanism O
of O
the O
missense O

remains O
unknown. O
We O
report O
a O
novel O
heterozygous O
missense O
mutation, O
H194Q, O
in O
a O
familial O
case O
of O
Shprintzen O

and O
show O
that O
this O
and O
the O
two O
previously O
reported O
missense O
mutations O
result O
in O
gain O
of O
function, O
possibly O
through O
stabilization O
of O
the O
protein O

DNA O
complex. O
We O
therefore O
conclude O
that O
TBX1 O
gain-of-function O
mutations O
can O
result O
in O
the O
same O
phenotypic O
spectrum O
as O
haploinsufficiency O
caused O

We O
have O
recently O
evaluated O
a O
family O
in O
which O
this O
was O
not O
the O

Maternal O

(WAS; O
MIM O

had O
two O
different O
but O
contiguous O

in O
WAS. O
The O
proband O
had O
an O
A O
deletion O
in O

242 O
in O
exon O
7 O
of O
WAS; O
his O
two O
cousins O
had O
a O
C O
deletion O
in O
codon O
241. O
The O
mother O
of O
the O
proband O
was O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
A O
deletion O
allele, O
but O
her O
three O
sisters, O
including O
the O
mother O
of O
the O
affected O

were O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
C O
deletion. O
Both O

occurred O
on O
the O

a O

These O

We O

a O
single-base O

at O
the O

of O
exon O
6, O
in O
a O
Turkish O
patient O
(GS12) O

This O

resulted O
in O
the O
skipping O
of O
exon O

and O
exons O

To O

why O
the O

7 I-MUT
skipping, O
nuclear O
RNA O
was O
separated O

both O
were O
analyzed O
by O
RT-PCR. O
In O
nuclear O
RNA, O
SCOT O
mRNA O

exon O
6 I-MUT

was O
predominant O
and O
mRNA O
with O
exons O
6 I-MUT

was O
hardly O
detected, O
whereas O
the O
latter O
became O
one O
of O
major O
mRNA O
species O
in O
cytoplasmic O
RNA. O
This O
discrepancy O
was O
interpreted O
as O
follows: O
exon O
6 I-MUT
skipping O
causes O
a O
frameshift O
and O
nonsense-mediated O
RNA O
decay O
in O
the O
cytosol, O
so O
mRNA O
with O
exon O
6 I-MUT

was O
unstable. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
SCOT O
mRNA O
with O
exons O
6 I-MUT

is O
a O
minor O
transcript O
but O
it O
retains O
the O
reading-frame O
and O
is O
stable O
in O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
latter O
mRNA O
is O
more O
abundant O
under O
steady-state O

as O

to O
the O

gene, O
which O

SETTING: O
Mutation O

RESULTS: O
Two O
affected O

in O
one O

were O
homozygous O
for O
a O
101-bp O

in O
intron O
9. O
Haplotype O
analysis O
of O
the O
SLC34A3 O
locus O
in O
the O
family O
showed O
that O
the O
two O
deletions O
are O
on O
different O
haplotypes. O
An O

individual O
with O
HHRH O
was O
a O

CONCLUSION: O
HHRH O
is O

The O
identification O
of O
three O

suggests O
that O
the O

We O

Therefore, O

genotyped. O
PATIENTS: O
The O
five O

RESULTS: O
Three O

Among O
them, O
V311fs B-MUT

Two O

CONCLUSION: O
The O

The O

In O

that O
this O

addition O
to O
three O
previously O

that O

The O

the O

Genetic O

syndrome. O
BACKGROUND: O
Sudden O
infant O
death O
syndrome O
(SIDS) O
constitutes O
the O
most O
frequent O
cause O
of O
death O
in I-MUT
the O
postperinatal O
period O
in I-MUT
Germany. O
Recently, O
a O
lethal O
phenotype O
characterized O
by O
sudden O
infant O
death O
with O
dysgenesis O
of O
the O
testes O
syndrome O
(SIDDT) O
was O
identified O
to O
be O
caused O
by O
loss O
of O
function O
mutations O
in I-MUT
the O
TSPYL1 O
gene. O
PURPOSE: O
The O
study's O
purpose O
was O
to O
reveal O
a O
possible O
role O
of O
TSPYL1 O
in I-MUT
SIDS. O
METHODS: O
DNA O
samples O
of O
126 O
SIDS O
cases O
and O
261 O
controls O
were O
investigated. O
RESULTS: O
We O
found O
five O
sequence O
variations, O
each O
of O
them O
causing O
an O
amino O
acid O
substitution. O
No O
Hardy O
Weinberg O
disequilibrium O
and O
no O
significant O
difference O
in I-MUT
allele O
frequencies O
between O
patients O
and O
controls O
were O
observed O
for O
any O
variation. O
In O
one O
female O
patient O
a O
p.F366L B-MUT
amino O
acid O
polymorphism O
was O
found O
heterozygous, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
displayed O
in I-MUT
controls. O
A O
pathogenic O
implication O
of O
this O
substitution, O
which O
is O
conserved O
in I-MUT
primates O
and O
rodents, O
cannot O
be O
ruled O
out O
completely. O
Because O
SIDDT O
is O
the O
result O
of O
homozygous O
TSPYL1 O
mutations, O
this O
heterozygous O
exchange O
cannot O
solely O
explain O
the O
sudden O
death O
in I-MUT
this O
child. O
The O
reported O
mutation O
associated O
with O
SIDDT O
(457_458insG) O
was O
not O
detectable O
in I-MUT
our O
cohort. O
CONCLUSION: O
No O
association O
of O
sequence O
variations O
in I-MUT
the O
TSPYL1 O
gene O
and O
SIDS O
has O
been O
found O
in I-MUT

and O
is O
required O
for O

are O
among O
the O

Here, O
we O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
mutation O
in O
this O

RESULTS: O
Sporadic O

PURPOSE: O
In O
the O

EXPERIMENTAL O
DESIGN: O
Genomic O
DNA O
was O
purified O
from O
peripheral O
blood O
mononuclear O
cells O
or O
tissue O
specimens. O
Amplified O
ACE O
gene O

were O
identified O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
190- O
or O
490-bp O
fragments, O
respectively. O
Local O
expression O
of O
ACE O
was O
investigated O
by O
immunohistochemistry. O
RESULTS: O
Twenty-four O
of O
113 O
(21%) O
gastric O
cancer O
patients O
had O
the O
II, O
57 O
(51%) O
the O
ID, O
and O
32 O
(28%) O
the O

genotype. O
The O
distribution O
of O
the O
ACE O
genotypes O
did O
not O
differ O
significantly O
from O
the O
control O
group O
of O
189 O
patients O
without O
gastric O

However, O
the O
ACE O

correlated O
with O
the O
number O
of O
lymph O

and O
the O
Unio O
Internationale O
Contra O

Patients O
with O
the O
II O
genotype O
had O
a O
highly O
significantly O
smaller O
number O
of O
lymph O

(P O
< O
0.001) O
and O
a O
significantly O
lower O
UICC O
tumor O
stage O
(P O
= O
0.01) O
than O
patients O
with O
the O
DD O
genotype. O
No O
correlation O
was O
found O
between O
tumor O
type, O
tumor O
location, O
local O
tumor O
growth, O
distant O

and O
the O
ACE O
genotype. O
The O
expression O
of O
ACE O
in O
gastric O
cancer O
was O
investigated O
by O
immunohistochemistry O
in O
100 O
of O
113 O
patients. O
ACE O
was O
expressed O
by O
endothelial O
cells O
in O
all O
(100%) O
specimens O
and O
by O
tumor O
cells O
in O
56 O
(56%) O
specimens. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
study O
shows O
that O
ACE O
is O
expressed O
locally O
in O
gastric O
cancer O
and O
that O
the O
gene O
polymorphism O
influences O
metastatic O
behavior. O

we O
studied O
the O
proband O
in O
a O
small O
nuclear O
family O
of O
Chinese O

type O
VII O
collagen O
gene O
leading O
to O
recessive O
dystrophic O
epidermolysis O
bullosa, O
Hallopeau-Siemens O
variant O
(HS-RDEB). O
The O
maternal O
mutation O
is O
a O
single O
base O
pair O
deletion O
of O
a O
cytosine O
nucleotide O
in O
exon O
26, O
designated O
3472delC, O
resulting O
in O
a O
frameshift O
and O
a O
premature O

codon O
(PTC) O
within O
the O
same O
exon, O
7 I-MUT
bp O
downstream O
of O
the O
site O
of O
the O

located O
at O
the O
5' O
donor O
splice O
site O
within O
intron O
51, O
designated O
IVS51 B-MUT
+ I-MUT
1G-->A. O
This O
mutation O
leads O
to O
the O
activation O
of O
a O
cryptic O
splice O
site, O
32 O
bp O
downstream O
of O
the O

To O
our O
knowledge, O
these O
two O
mutations O
have O
not O
been O
previously O
reported. O
These O
findings O
extend O
the O
body O
of O
evidence O
for O
compound O

system O
involvement: O
a O
new O
mutation O
in O
the O
ARSA O
gene. O
BACKGROUND: O
Metachromatic O
leukodystrophy O
(MLD) O
is O
a O
lysosomal O
storage O
disease O
caused O
by O
the O
deficiency O
of O
arylsulfatase O
A O
(ARSA). O
Clinically, O
the O
disease O
is O
heterogeneous O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
age O
of O
onset, O
affection O
of O
peripheral O
and O
central O
nervous O
systems, O
and O

OBJECTIVES: O
To O
analyze O
mutations O
in O
the O
ARSA O
gene O
of O
a O
patient O
with O
adult-onset O
MLD O
with O
no O

and O
to O
emphasize O
the O
clinical, O
neuroradiologic, O
neuropathologic, O
and O
genetic O
features O
of O
the O
disease. O
DESIGN: O
Case O
study O
of O
a O
patient O
clinically O
presenting O
with O
rapidly O
progressive O
dementia O
and O
behavioral O
abnormalities. O
We O
report O
the O
findings O
of O
clinical O
evaluation O
and O
neurophysiologic O
and O
neuropathologic O
studies O
of O
peripheral O
nerves; O
we O
also O
performed O
DNA O
sequence O
analysis, O
transfections, O
metabolic O
labeling, O
and O

of O
mutant O
ARSA O
polypeptides. O
SETTING: O
Genetic O
research O
and O
clinical O
unit, O
university O
hospital. O
RESULTS: O
Genetic O
analysis O
revealed O
homozygosity O
for O
a O
novel O
mutation O
in O
exon O
3 O
of O
ARSA O
(F219V). O
This O
substitution O
leads O
to O
a O
misfolded O
unstable O
enzyme O
with O
a O
specific O
activity O
less O
than O
1% O
of O
normal. O
There O
were O
no O
clinical O
or O
neurophysiologic O
signs O
of O
peripheral O
nervous O
system O
dysfunction. O
Typical O
neuropathologic O
signs O
for O
MLD O
were O
absent O
from O
nerve O
biopsy O
specimens. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
novel O
mutation O
is O
associated O
with O
progressive O
psychocognitive O
impairment O
without O
clinical O
or O
electrophysiologic O
signs O
and O
only O
minor O
morphologic O
signs O
of O
peripheral O
nerve O
affection. O
The O
F219V B-MUT
substitution O
causes O
reduction O
in O
enzyme O
activity O
to O
an O
extent O
unexpected O
for O
an O
adult O

with O
MLD. O

Parkin O
mutations O
and O
early-onset O
parkinsonism O
in O
a O
Taiwanese O
cohort. O
BACKGROUND: O
Loss O
of O
function O
of O
the O
parkin O
gene O
(PRKN) O
is O
the O
predominant O
genetic O
cause O
of O
juvenile O
and O
early-onset O
parkinsonism O
in O
Japan, O
Europe, O
and O
the O
United O
States. O
OBJECTIVES: O
To O
evaluate O
the O
frequency O
of O
PRKN O
mutations O
in O
Taiwanese O
(ethnic O
Chinese) O
patients O
with O
early-onset O
parkinsonism O
and O
to O
explore O
genotype-phenotype O
correlations. O
DESIGN: O
Clinical O
assessment O
included O
medical, O
neurologic, O
and O
psychiatric O
evaluation. O
Genomic O
DNA O
sequencing O
and O
quantitative O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
were O
performed O
to O
identify O
PRKN O
mutations. O
Gene O
expression O
was O
examined O
in O
patient O
lymphoblastoid O
cell O
lines, O
in O
which O
PRKN O
mutations O
were O
identified. O
PATIENTS: O
Forty-one O
Taiwanese O
patients O
with O
early-onset O
parkinsonism O
(aged O
<50 O
years O
at O
onset). O
RESULTS: O
Four O
of O
41 O
probands O
had O
PRKN O
mutations. O
One O
proband O
had O
compound O
heterozygous O
mutations, O
with O
a O
PRKN O
exon O
2 I-MUT
deletion O
and O
an O
exon O
7 O
G284R B-MUT
substitution. O
The O
phenotype O
resembled O
typical O
Parkinson O
disease. O
Three O
patients O
were O
mutation O
carriers. O
One O
proband O
had O
PRKN O
exon O
2 I-MUT
and O
exon O
3 I-MUT
deletions O
in O
the O
same O
allele. O
However, O
this O
patient's O
phenotype O
was O
that O
of O
classic O
"parkin-proven" O
autosomal O
recessive O
juvenile O
parkinsonism, O
characterized O
by O
symmetrical O
foot O
dystonia O
at O
onset, O
gait O
disturbance, O
diurnal O
change, O
and O
very O
slow O
progression. O
The O
2 I-MUT
remaining O
carriers O
had O
novel O
heterozygous O
exon O
11 O
R396G B-MUT
substitutions. O
Patients O
with O
PRKN O
mutations O
were O
younger O
at O
onset O
than O
those O
without O
mutations, O
and O
they O
required O
a O
lower O
dose O
of O
levodopa O
despite O
longer O
disease O
duration. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Mutations O
in O
PRKN O
are O
a O
rare O
cause O
of O
early-onset O
parkinsonism O
in O
Taiwanese O
individuals. O
The O
overall O
mutation O
frequency, O
adjusted O
for O
age O
at O
onset, O
was O
comparable O
with O
that O
reported O
for O
white O
cohorts; O
however, O
the O
point O
mutations O
identified O
seem O
to O
be O
population O
specific. O

METHODS: O
Thirty-seven O
unrelated O
patients O
were O
studied, O
18 O
with O
LCD O
and O
19 O
with O
GCD. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
LCD O
or O

was O
made O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

Exons O
and O
flanking O
intron O
sequences O
of O
the O
TGFBI O
gene O
were O
amplified O
by O
PCR O
with O
specific O
primers. O
PCR O
products O
were O
screened O
by O
the O
method O
of O
single-strand O

followed O
by O
sequencing. O
Mutations O
were O
confirmed O
by O
screening O
at O

RESULTS: O
Mutations O
were O
identified O
in I-MUT
14 O
of O
18 O
patients O
with O
LCD O
and O
in I-MUT
all O
19 O
patients O
with O
GCD. O
In O
LCD, O
three O
novel O

found O
were O
glycine-594-valine B-MUT
(Gly594Val) O
in I-MUT

of O
arginine B-MUT
124-to-cysteine I-MUT
(Arg124Cys) O
was O
found O
in I-MUT
8 O
of O
18 O
patients O
and O
histidine B-MUT
626-to-arginine I-MUT
(His626Arg) O
in I-MUT
2 I-MUT
of O
18 O
patients. O
Atypical O
clinical O
features O
for O
LCD O
were O
noted O
in I-MUT
patients O
with O
the O
Gly594Val B-MUT
and O
Val624-Val625del B-MUT
mutations. O
In O
GCD, O
18 O
patients O
with O
GCD O
type O
I O
had O
a I-MUT
mutation O
of O
arginine B-MUT
555-to-tryptophan I-MUT
(Arg555Trp) O
and O
1 I-MUT
patient O
with O
GCD O
type O
III O
(Reis-Bucklers O
dystrophy), O
had O
the O
Arg124Leu B-MUT
mutation. O
Seven O
novel O
single-nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
(SNPs) O
were O
also O
found, O
of O
which O
a I-MUT
change O
of O
leucine B-MUT
269 I-MUT
to I-MUT
phenylalanine I-MUT
(Leu269Phe) O
was O
found O
in I-MUT
12 I-MUT
of O
18 O
patients O
with O
the O
Arg555Trp B-MUT
mutation. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Arg124Cys B-MUT
and O
Arg555Trp B-MUT
appear O
to I-MUT
be O
the O
predominant O
mutations O
causing O
LCD O
and O
GCD, O
respectively, O
in I-MUT
the O
population O

The O
novel O

identified O
in I-MUT
this O
study O
are O
associated O
with O
distinct O

beta-chain O
variants: O
Hb O
Tripoli O
[beta26(B8)Glu-->Ala] O
and O
Hb O
Tizi-Ouzou O
[beta29(B11)Gly-->Ser]. O
Two O

The O
two O

are O
characterized O
by O
DNA O
sequencing O
and O
mass O

(MS). O
Hematological O
abnormalities O
were O
found O
in O
the O
two O

The O
presence O
of O
microcytosis O

is O
explained O
by O
an O
additional O
homozygous O
3.7 O
kb O
alpha(+) O
thalassemic O
deletion O
for O
the O
carrier O
of O
Hb O
Tizi-Ouzou. O
Hb O
Tizi-Ouzou O
showed O
a I-MUT
slight O
instability O
in O

The O
same O
hematological O
abnormalities O
associated O
with O
anemia O
are O
difficult O
to O
explain O
for O
Hb O
Tripoli's O
carrier O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
an O

and O
could O
suggest O
a I-MUT

Thais O
(87 O

and O
Caucasians O
(94 O

Four O

six O

were O
detected. O
The O

two O

Although O

the O

BACKGROUND: O
Mutations O
in O
COL17A1, O
coding O
for O
type O

collagen, O
cause O
junctional O
epidermolysis O
bullosa O
with O
an O
ultrastructural O
plane O

OBJECTIVES: O
To O
identify O
the O
COL17A1 O
mutations O
in O
a O
child O
with O
reduced O
type O
XVII O
collagen O
expression O
and O

PATIENT O
AND O
METHODS: O
Protein O
expression O
and O
level O
of O
tissue O
separation O
were O
studied O
by O
immunofluorescence O
and O
electron O
microscopy. O
The O
mutations O
were O
identified O
by O
analysing O
the O
patient's O
DNA O
and O
mRNA. O
RESULTS: O
Immunofluorescence O
microscopy O
performed O
on O
nonlesional O
skin O
demonstrated O
absence O
of O
the O
type O
XVII O
collagen O
endodomain O
and O
presence, O
although O
reduced, O
of O
the O
shed O
ectodomain. O
Electron O
microscopy O
showed O
that O
the O
plane O
of O
cleavage O
was O
through O
the O
basal O
cells, O
not O
through O
the O
lamina O
lucida. O
Two O
heterozygous O
mutations O
were O
identified O
in O
COL17A1: O
a O
new O
3'-acceptor O
splice-site O
mutation O
in O
intron O
21 O
(1877-2A-->C), O
and O
a O
deletion O
in O
exon O
48 O
(3432delT). O
The O
splice-site O
mutation O
in O
intron O
21 O
results O
in O
alternative O
transcripts O
of O
which O
two O
are O
in-frame, O
with O
deletions O
of O
the O
first O
nine O
codons O
of O
exon O
22 O
and O
the O
entire O
exon O
22, O
respectively. O
By O
Western O

analysis, O
a O
type O
XVII O
collagen O
molecule O
was O
detected O
that O
was O
slightly O
smaller O
than O
normal. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Occasionally O
mutations O
in O
the O
COL17A1 O
gene O
may O
result O
in O
split O
levels O
suggesting O
epidermolysis O
bullosa O
simplex O
rather O
than O
junctional O
epidermolysis O
bullosa. O

Mouse O

cells O
with O
a O

deletion O
of O
Mrad9, O
the O
mouse O
ortholog O
of O
this O
gene, O
were O
created O
to O
evaluate O
its O
function O
in O
mammals. O
Mrad9(-/-) O
cells O
demonstrated O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
spontaneous O
chromosome O
aberrations O
and O
HPRT O
mutations, O
indicating O
a O
role O
in O
the O
maintenance O
of O
genomic O

These O
cells O
were O
also O
extremely O
sensitive O
to O
UV O
light, O
gamma O
rays, O
and O
hydroxyurea, O
and O
heterozygotes O
were O
somewhat O
sensitive O
to O
the O
last O
two O
agents O
relative O
to O
Mrad9(+/+) O
controls. O
Mrad9(-/-) O
cells O
could O
initiate O
but O
not O
maintain O
gamma-ray-induced O
G(2) O
delay O
and O
retained O
the O
ability O
to O
delay O
DNA O
synthesis O
rapidly O
after O
UV O
irradiation, O
suggesting O
that O
checkpoint O
abnormalities O
contribute O
little O
to O
the O
radiosensitivity O
observed. O
Ectopic O
expression O
of O
Mrad9 O
or O
human O
HRAD9 O
complemented O
Mrad9(-/-) O
cell O
defects, O
indicating O
that O
the O
gene O
has O
radioresponse O
and O
genomic O

functions O
that O
are O
evolutionarily O
conserved. O
Mrad9(+/-) O
mice O
were O
generated, O
but O
heterozygous O
intercrosses O
failed O
to O
yield O
Mrad9(-/-) O
pups, O
since O
embryos O
died O
at O
midgestation. O
Furthermore, O
Mrad9(-/-) O
mouse O
embryo O

were O
not O
viable. O
These O
investigations O
establish O
Mrad9 O
as O
a O
key O
mammalian O
genetic O
element O
of O
pathways O
that O
regulate O
the O
cellular O

Genetics O
of O
endometriosis: O
a O
role O
for O
the O
progesterone O

gene O
polymorphism O
PROGINS? O
OBJECTIVE: O
Endometriosis O
is O
a O
steroid-dependent O
disease O
with O
a O
particular O
genetic O
background, O
but O
the O
locations O
of O
possible O
genomic O
aberrations O
are O
still O
poorly O
clarified. O
We O
have O
investigated O
the O
potential O
association O
between O
endometriosis O
and O
the O
PROGINS O
306 O
base O
pair O
insertion O
polymorphism O
in O

G O
of O
the O
progesterone O
receptor O
(PR) O
gene, O
which O
has O
been O
reported O
previously O
to O
segregate O
with O
this O
disease. O
DESIGN: O
In O
a O
case-control O
study, O
we O
examined O
the O
PROGINS O
polymorphism O
of O
the O
progesterone O
receptor O
gene O
in O
131 O
Italian O
women O
affected O
by O
endometriosis O
diagnosed O
according O
to O
published O
criteria O
for O
the O
definition O
of O
the O

disease. O
Control O
subjects O
were O
represented O
by O
127 O
Italian O
women O
without O
laparoscopic O
evidence O
of O
the O
disease. O
MEASUREMENTS: O
Peripheral O
blood O
samples, O
DNA O

(PCR) O
were O
used O
to O
genotype O
women O
for O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
PROGINS O
polymorphism. O
RESULTS: O
We O
found O
a O
statistically O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
distribution O
of O
PROGINS O
genotypes O
between O
patients O
with O
and O
without O
endometriosis. O
The O
frequency O
of O
the O
PROGINS O
allele O
T2 O
was O
17.2% O
and O
11%, O
respectively, O
in O
affected O

and O
in O
controls O
[odds O
ratio O
(OR) O
= O
1.7, O
95% O
confidence O
interval O
(CI) O
1.0-2.8]. O
This O
association O
was O
stronger O
in O
patients O
with O
more O
severe O
forms O
of O
endometriosis, O
such O
as O
an O
infiltrating O
disease O
or O
a O
disease O
characterized O
by O
severe O
pelvic O
adhesions O
(OR O
2.4, O
95% O
CI O
1.2-4.8; O
and O
OR O
2.7, O
95% O
CI O
1.4-5.3, O
respectively). O
Combination O
of O
the O
results O
from O
an O
earlier O
study O
and O
the O
current O
data O
indicates O
that O
carrying O
the O
allele O
variant O
T2 O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
twofold O
increase O
in O
the O
risk O
of O
developing O
endometriosis O
(OR O
2.0, O
95% O
CI O
1.3-2.9). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
results O
further O
support O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
PROGINS O
polymorphism O
of O
the O
progesterone O
receptor O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
endometriosis. O

The O
Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 O

is O
involved O
in O
many O
aspects O
of O

Aberrant O
function O

In O
this O
article, O
we O
report O
the O
consequences O
of O
Mre11 O
dysfunction O
for O
the O
stability O
of O
mitotic O

Although O
plants O
homozygous O
for O
a O
T-DNA O

in O
a O
conserved O
region O
of O
the O
MRE11 O
gene O
are O
viable, O
they O
exhibit O
growth O

and O
are O
infertile. O
Analysis O
of O
mitotic O
chromosomes O
prepared O
from O
the O
mutant O
plants O
revealed O
abundant O
dicentric O
chromosomes O
and O
chromosomal O

Fluorescence O
in O

hybridization O
showed O
that O
anaphase O

are O
often O
formed O
by O

The O
frequency O
of O
chromosome O
fusions O
was O
not O
reduced O
in O
mre11 O
ku70 O
double O

suggesting O
that O

independent O
of O
the O

revealed O
massive O
chromosome O

and O
the O
absence O
of O

in O
the O

of O
meiosis. O
The O
fragmentation O
was O
substantially O
suppressed O
in O
mre11 O
spo11-1 O
double O

indicating O
that O
Mre11 O
is O
required O
for O

not O
for O
the O

(RTH) O
is O
a O
rare O
disorder, O
usually O
inherited O
as O
an O

Patients O

RTH O
are O
usually O
euthyroid O
but O
can O
occasionally O
present O
with O

Affected O
individuals O

(TR-beta). O
We O
present O
a O
patient O
with O
RTH O
found O
to O
be O
homo-/hemizygous O
for O
a O
mutation O
in O
the O
TR-beta O
gene. O
The O

either O
on O
both O

The O
I280S B-MUT

The O
severe O
phenotype O
with O
seriously O
impaired O
intellectual O
development, O
hyperkinetic O
behaviour, O
tachycardia, O
hearing O
and O

is O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
dominant O

of O
the O
I280S B-MUT

there O
were O
no O
differences O

However, O
six O

FAFLP-PCR O
fingerprinting O
and O

revealed O
that O
all O
16 O

that O
displayed O
identical O
RAPD-PCR O

had O
highly O

but O
not O

demonstrating O
that O
these O

A I-MUT
new O
but O
frequent O
mutation O
of O
apoB-100-apoB O
His3543Tyr. O
ApolipoproteinB O
100 O
(apoB-100) O
is I-MUT
an O
important O
component O
of O
atherogenic O
lipoproteins O
such O
as O
LDL O
and O
serves O
as O
a O
ligand O
for O
the O
LDL-receptor. O
Familial O
defective O
apolipoproteinB O
100 O
(FDB) O
is I-MUT
caused O
by O
a O
R3500Q B-MUT
mutation O
of O
the O
apoB O
gene O
and O
results O
in O
decreased O
binding O
of O
LDL O
to O
the O
LDL-receptor. O
So O
far O
FDB O
is I-MUT
the O
most O
frequent O
and O
best O
studied O
alteration O
of O
apoB-100. O
Apart O
from O
this, O
three O
other O
apoB O
mutations, O
R3500W, O
R3531C B-MUT
and O
R3480W, O
affecting O
binding O
to O
the O
LDL-receptor O
are O
known O
to O
date. O
We O
screened O
the O
apoB O
gene O
segment O
of O
codons O
3448-3561 O
by O
denaturing O
gradient O
gel O

(DGGE) O
analysis O
in O
a O
total O
of O
853 O
consecutively O
sampled O
German O
patients O
undergoing O
diagnostic O
coronary O
angiography O
for O
suspected O
CAD. O
By O
this, O
a O
new O
single O
base O
mutation O
was O
detected O
and O
confirmed O
by O
DNA O
sequencing. O
The O
mutation, O
CAC(3543)TAC B-MUT
results O
in O
a O
His3543Tyr B-MUT
substitution O
in O
apoB-100 O
(H3543Y). O
The O
prevalence O
of O
heterozygotes O
for O
H3543Y B-MUT
in O
the O
study O
population O
was O
0.47% O
compared O
to O
0.12% O
for O
the O
known O
Arg B-MUT
3500 I-MUT
Gln I-MUT
(R3500Q) O
mutation. O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
new O
mutation O
is I-MUT
four O
times O
more O
frequent O
than O
"classical" O
FDB O
and O
thus O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
most O
common O
apoB O

in O

in O
the O
thiazide-sensitive O

in O
Japanese O

BACKGROUND: O
Gitelman's O
syndrome O
(GS) O
is I-MUT
an O

disorder O
resulting O
from O
inactivating O
mutations O
in O
the O

To O

almost O
90 O

have O
been O
identified. O
It O
is I-MUT
possible O
that O
there O
is I-MUT
a I-MUT
population-specific O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
analysed O
mutations O
in O
the O
NCCT O
gene O
of O
seven O
Japanese O
patients O
with O
GS. O
METHODS: O
Peripheral O

were O
isolated O
from O
patients O
with O
GS, O
their O
family O

In O
patients O

we O
undertook O
cDNA O

RESULTS: O
We O
identified O
nine O
mutations. O
Five O
of O
them O
[c.185C>T O
(Thr60Met), O

have O
been O

but O
not O
in O

CONCLUSIONS: O
We O
found O
four O
novel O

in O
the O
NCCT O

in O
seven O
Japanese O

Moreover, O
our O

suggests O
that O
the O

in O
the O

revealed O
2 I-MUT
consecutive O

each O
located O
in O
a O

predicts O
a O

However, O
one O

with O
an O

We O
have O
previously O
mapped O
a O
putative O
prostate O
cancer O
tumor-suppressor O
gene O
to O
a O
1-2 O
Mb O
region O
of O
12p12-13. O
Initial O
work O
to O
identify O
the O
tumor O

at O
this O
locus O
focused O
on O
candidates O
previously O
implicated O
in O
malignancy; O
however, O
mutational O
and O

analyses O
failed O
to O
identify O
significant O
genomic O
events. O
An O
alternative O
approach O
is O
to O
use O
expression O
analysis O
to O
prioritize O
the O
genes O
within O
the O
region O
of O
interest. O
This O
experimental O
design O
is O
based O
on O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
tumor-suppressor O
genes O
demonstrate O
decreased O
expression O
in O
tumors O
compared O
to O
normals. O
Herein, O
we O
narrow O
the O
region O
of O

using O
deletion O
mapping O
data O
and O
employ O
expression O
analysis O
to O
prioritize O
the O
genes O
in O
the O
minimal O

region. O
Highly O
informative O

spanning O
our O

were O
used O
to O
assess O
for O
loss O
of O
heterozygosity O
in O
99 O
tumor O
and O
normal O

pairs. O
The O
minimal O

of O

was O
determined O
to O
be O
approximately O
500 O
kb O
bounded O
by O
D12S391 O
and O
A002Q26. O
Publically O
available O
databases O
place O
7 O
genes O
within O
this O
minimal O

region. O
An O
additional O
3 O
genes O
lie O
just O
outside O
this O

and O
could O
possibly O
be O
inactivated O
by O

or O
alternative O

variants. O
Relative O
levels O
of O

of O
these O
10 O

were O
determined O
in O

were O
significantly O

The O

studied O
in O
151 O

have O
lost O
one O

We O
hypothesized, O
therefore, O
that O
the O

might O
be O
mutated O
in O
the O

Because O

we O

The O

the O

Additionally, O

Finally, O
Northern O

revealed O
the O

These O

were O
not O

Because O

in O
the O

overlapped O

We O

In O
this O

we O

These O
include O
C219W-alpha O

affecting O
the O

Recombinant O

the O
C219W-alpha O

no O
catalytic O

The O

These O
E1 O
mutations O
are O
ubiquitously O

in I-MUT
homozygous-affected O
patients. O
The O
H391R B-MUT
substitution O
in I-MUT
the O
E2 O

abolishes O
the O
key O
catalytic O
residue O
that O
functions O
as O
a O
general O
base O
in I-MUT
the O
acyltransfer O
reaction, O
resulting O
in I-MUT
a O
completely O

E2 O
component. O
However, O
wild-type O
E1 O
activity O
is O
enhanced O
by O
E1 O
binding O
to I-MUT
this O
full-length O
mutant O
E2 O
in I-MUT

We O
propose O
that O
the O
augmented O
E1 O
activity O
is O
responsible O
for O
robust O
thiamin O
responsiveness O
in I-MUT
homozygous O
patients O
carrying O
the O
H391R B-MUT
E2 O
mutation O
and O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
full-length O
mutant O
E2 O
is O
diagnostic O
of O
this O
MSUD O
phenotype. O
The O
present O
results O
offer O
a O
structural O
and O
biochemical O
basis O
for O
these O
novel O

and O
will O
facilitate O

To O
analyze O
the O

we O

We O

eight O

The O

that O
the O

During O

In O

also O

We O
investigated O
these O

No O
individual O
in O
these O

none O
had O
any O

EXO1-null O

This O

questions O
the O
functional O
significance O
of O
previously O

We O

prenatal O

involving O
an O
East O

that O

to O

the O

The O
initial O
work-up O
indicated O
that O
alpha-thalassemia O
was O
not O
a O
contributing O
factor, O
with O
both O
parents O
being O

(-alpha(3.7)/alphaalpha). O
However, O
the O

that O
the O

might O
be O
at O
risk O
for O
having O
children O
with O

Subsequent O
DNA O

demonstrated O
that O
the O

carried O
the O
Hb O

mutation, O
but O
failed O
to O
confirm O
that O
the O
mother O
carries O
the O

Sequence O

revealed O
that O
the O
mother O
was O
heterozygous O
for O
a O

yet O
had O

The O

also O

of O
the O
delta-globin O

in O

which O
gave O

The O

neurohypophyseal O
diabetes O
insipidus O
(FNDI) O
is O
a O
rare O
form O
of O

and O
analysed O
the O

SUBJECTS O
AND O
DESIGN: O
Four O
affected O
members O
and O
one O
nonaffected O
member O
from O
one O
Brazilian O
family O
with O
FNDI O
were O
studied. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
central O
DI O
was O
established O
by O
fluid O

test O
and O
hypertonic O
saline O
infusion. O
Two O
affected O
members O
were O
assessed O
twice O
within O
a O
6-year O
interval. O
For O
molecular O
analysis, O
genomic O
DNA O
was O
extracted O
and O
the O
AVP-NPII O

RESULTS: O
The O
functional O
assessment O
of O
patients O
with O
FNDI O
over O
time O
confirmed O
a O
progressive O
loss O
in O
AVP O

Two O
patients O
were O
first O
diagnosed O
as O
partial O
central O
DI O
and, O
several O
years O
later, O
they O
developed O
severe O

CONCLUSION: O
Our O
data O
demonstrate O
a O
gradual O

due O
to O
a O
novel O

Congenital O
hypothyroidism O
due O
to O
a O
new O
deletion O
in O
the O
sodium/iodide O
symporter O
protein. O
OBJECTIVE: O
Iodide O
transport O
defect O
(ITD) O
is O
a O
rare O
disorder O
characterised O
by O
an O
inability O
of O
the O
thyroid O
to O
maintain O
an O
iodide O
gradient O
across O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
of O
thyroid O
follicular O
cells, O
that O
often O
results O
in O
congenital O
hypothyroidism. O
When O
present O
the O
defect O
is O
also O
found O
in O
the O
salivary O
glands O
and O
gastric O
mucosa O
and O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
arise O
from O
abnormalities O
of O
the O
sodium/iodide O
symporter O
(NIS). O
PATIENT: O
We O
describe O
a O
woman O
with O
hypothyroidism O
identified O
at O
the O
3rd O
month O
of O
life. O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
ITD O
was O
suspected O
because O
of O
nodular O
goitre, O
and O
little O
if O
any O
iodide O
uptake O
by O
the O
thyroid O
and O
salivary O
glands. O
Treatment O
with O
iodide O
partially O
corrected O
the O
hypothyroidism; O
however, O
long-term O
substitution O
therapy O
with O
L-thyroxine O
was O
started. O
MEASUREMENTS: O
Thyroid O
radioiodide O
uptake O
was O
only O
1.4% O
and O
0.3% O
at O
1 O
and O
24 O
h O
after O
the O
administration O
of O
recombinant O
human O
TSH. O
The O
saliva O
to O
plasma O
I- O
ratio O
was O
1.1 O
indicating O
that O
the O
inability O
of O
the O
thyroid O
gland O
to O
concentrate O
I- O
was O
also O
present O
in O
the O
salivary O
glands. O
RESULTS: O
Analysis O
of O
the O
patient's O
NIS O
gene O
revealed O
a O
15 O
nucleotide O
(nt) O
deletion O
of O
the O
coding O
sequence O
(nt O
1314 O
through O
nt O
1328) O
and O
the O
insertion O
of O
15 O
nt O
duplicating O
the O
first O
15 O
nt O
of O
the O
adjacent O
intron. O
The O
patient O
was O
homozygous O
for O
this O
insertion/deletion, O
while O
both O
consanguineous O
parents O
were O
heterozygous. O
This O
deletion O
predicts O
the O
production O
of O
a O
protein O
lacking O
the O
five O
terminal O
amino O
acids O
of O
exon O
XI O
(439-443) I-MUT
which O
are O
located O
in O
the O
6th O
intracellular O
loop. O
COS-7 O

with O
a O
vector O
expressing O
the O
mutant O
del-(439-443) B-MUT
NIS O
failed O
to O

iodide, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
mutation O
was O
the O
direct O
cause O
of O
the O
ITD O
in O
this O
patient. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
conclusion O
we O
describe O
the O

INTRODUCTION: O
A O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphism O
(SNP) O
within O
a O
binding O
site O
of O
the O
intestinal-specific O
transcription O
factor O
Cdx-2 O
in O
the O
promoter O
region O
of O
the O
human O
vitamin O
D O
receptor O
(VDR) O
gene O
was O
previously O
reported. O
It O
was O
found O
to O
modulate O
the O
transcription O
of O
the O
hVDR O
gene O
and O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
decreased O
bone O
mineral O
density O
in O
a O
small O
group O
of O
postmenopausal O
Japanese O
women. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
VDR O
Cdx-2 O
genotype O
and O
risk O
of O
fracture. O
METHODS: O
We O
first O
determined O
the O
location O
of O
this O
SNP O
in O
the O
VDR O
gene O
by O
sequencing O
analysis, O
and O
we O
developed O
an O
allele-specific O
multiplex O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
test O
to O
determine O
the O
Cdx-2 O
genotype. O
We O
then O
performed O
an O
ecological O
study O
in O
eight O
ethnic O
groups O
and O
an O
association O
analysis O
in O
a O
large O
epidemiological O
cohort O
of O
2848 O
Dutch O
white O
men O
and O
women, O

old. O
RESULTS O
AND O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
location O
of O
the O
G O
to O
A O
substitution O
was O
found O
in O
the O
promoter O
region O
of O
exon O
le O
(le-G-1739A) O
of O
the O
VDR O
gene. O
By O
comparing O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O
A-allele O
in O
eight O
different O
ethnic O
groups, O
we O
observed O
a O
negative O
correlation O
between O
prevalence O
of O
the O
A-allele O
and O
published O
hip O
fracture O
incidence O
rates O
in O
these O
ethnic O
groups O
(p O
= O
0.006 O
for O
men O
and O
p O
= O
0.02 O
for O
women), O
suggesting O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
this O
allele O
on O
fracture O
risk. O
Subsequently, O
in O
the O
association O
study, O
the O
A-allele O
(population O
frequency O
19%) O
was O
observed O
to O
have O
a O
protective O
effect O
on O
occurrence O
of O
osteoporotic O
fractures, O
especially O
for O
nonvertebral O
fracture O
in O
women O
(relative O
risk O
of O
AA O
versus O
GG O
genotype O
is O
0.2; O
95% O
CI, O
0.05-0.8). O
This O
effect O
remained O
after O
adjustment O
for O
age, O
weight, O
and O
bone O
mineral O
density. O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
A-allele O
of O
the O
VDR O
Cdx-2 O
polymorphism O
is O
present O
in O
whites, O
albeit O
at O
low O
frequency, O
and O
show O
a O
protective O
effect O
of O
this O
allele O
on O
risk O
of O
fracture. O

A O
glycine O

substitution O
of O
COL2A1 O
in O
a O
family O
with O
the O
Strudwick O
variant O
of O
spondyloepimetaphyseal O
dysplasia. O
BACKGROUND: O
Spondyloepimetaphyseal O
dysplasia O
(SEMD) O
is O
one O
of O
a O
clinically O
heterogeneous O
group O
of O
skeletal O
disorders, O
characterized O
by O
defective O
growth O
and O
modelling O
of O
the O
spine O
and O
long O
bones. O
Common O
clinical O
features O
include O
disproportionate O
short O
stature, O
malformed O
vertebrae O
and O
abnormal O
epiphyses O
or O
metaphyses. O
Some O
cases O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
mutations O
in O
the O
COL2A1 O
gene. O
AIM: O
To O
determine O
whether O
the O
autosomal O
dominant O
Strudwick-type O
SEMD O
in O
a O
three-generation O
family, O
showing O
specific O
phenotypical O
features O
such O
as O
chest O
deformity, O
limb O
shortening, O
myopia O
and O
early-onset O
degenerative O
osteoarthrosis, O
might O
be O
caused O
by O
a O
novel O
COL2A1 O
mutation. O
DESIGN: O
Genetic O
testing O
and O
clinical O
examination O
of O
family O
members. O
METHODS: O
Direct O
sequencing O
of O
PCR-amplified O
genomic O
DNA O
from O
the O
COL2A1 O
gene. O
RESULTS: O
A O
point O
mutation O
within O
exon O
20 O
of O
the O
COL2A1 O
gene O
was O
identified O
that O
substituted O
a O
glycine O
for O
an O
aspartic O
acid O
residue O
at O
codon O
262. O
DISCUSSION: O
All O
previously O
reported O
autosomal O
dominant O
mutations O
causing O
SEMD O
have O
substituted O
an O
obligate O
glycine O
within O
the O
triple O
helix, O
in O
particular O
at O
codons O
292, O
304 O
and O
709 O
in O
the O
three O
reported O
Strudwick-type O
patients. O
Additionally, O
a O
recurrent O
glycine O
substitution O
at O
codon O
154 O
has O
been O
identified O
in O
two O
unrelated O
Finnish O
cases O
with O
radiological O
features O
consistent O
with O
the O
Strudwick O
subtype. O
Our O
sixth O
helical O
glycine O
substitution O
extends O
the O
mutational O
spectrum O
and O
genotype/phenotype O
correlations O
of O
Strudwick-type O
SEMD. O

Genetic O
polymorphisms O

Genes O
of O
the O
renin-angiotensin O
system O
(RAS) O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
progression O

Among O
them, O
the O
angiotensin-converting O

and O
angiotensin O
II O
type O
1 I-MUT

We O
examined O
polymorphisms O
of O
these O
three O
genes O
for O
association O
with O
the O
development O
of O
interstitial O
nephritis O
and O
progression O
to O
end-stage O

The O
allele O
frequency O
and O
genotype O
distribution O
were O
compared O
in O
90 O
patients O
with O
interstitial O
nephritis O
and O
200 O
healthy O
controls. O
DNA O
samples O
were O
genotyped O
by O

(PCR). O
We O
did O
not O
find O
statistically O
significant O
differences O
between O
groups O
in O
the O
insertion/deletion O
polymorphism O
of O
the O
ACE O
gene. O
An O
involvement O
of O
M235T B-MUT
polymorphism O
of O
the O
AGT O
gene O
in O
renal O
disease O
was O
observed O
in O
our O
study. O
The O
frequency O
of O
the O
T I-MUT
allele O
was O
higher O
in O
patients O
than O
in O
controls O
(32% O
vs. O
24%). O
In O
the O
A1166C B-MUT
AT1R O
polymorphism O
the O
homozygous O
CC O
genotype O
was O
also O
more O
frequent O
in O
interstitial O
nephritis O
patients O
(7% O
vs. O
3.5%). O
In O
patients O
carrying O
the O
C I-MUT
allele, O
an O
average O
time O
to O
ESRD O
was O
significantly O
shorter O
than O
in O
subjects O
with O
the O

Our O
study O
shows O
the O

of O
the O
AGT O
and O
AT1R O
gene O
polymorphisms O
with O
the O
development O
and O
progression O
of O

The O
C I-MUT

BACKGROUND: O
In O
recent O
years O
several O
population O
based O
studies O
using O
restriction O

(RFLP) O
analysis O
have O
shown O
a O
higher O
rate O
of O
recent O

of O
tuberculosis O
than O
previously O
thought. O
This O
study O
was O
undertaken O
to O
determine O
the O

patterns O
of O
tuberculosis O
and O
the O
potential O
causes O
of O
recent O

on O
the O

(Spain). O
METHODS: O
The O

with O
tuberculosis O
confirmed O
by O
culture O
between O
1 O
January O
1993 O
and O
31 O
December O
1996 O
were O
typed O
by O
RFLP O
using O
the O
insertion O
sequence O
IS6110. O
A O
cluster O
was O
defined O
as O
two O
or O
more O
isolates O
with O
an O
identical O
RFLP O
pattern. O
Epidemiological O
linkage O
through O
contact O
tracing O
was O
investigated. O
RESULTS: O
Of O
the O
total O
of O
719 O
patients, O
153 O
(21.3%) O
were O
excluded O
because O
there O
was O
inadequate O
bacterial O
DNA O
for O
genotyping O
(n=129) O
or O
the O
isolates O
of O
Mycobacterium O
tuberculosis O
had O
less O
than O
five O
copies O
of O
IS6110 O
(n=24). O
The O
isolates O
from O
409 O
patients O
(72.3%) O
were O
grouped O
into O
78 O
different O
clusters O
with O
an O
estimated O
58.5% O
of O
the O
cases O
being O
due O
to O
recent O
transmission. O
Young O
age O
was O
the O
only O
significant O
predictor O
of O
clustering. O
Only O
in O
147 O
(35.9%) O
of O
the O
409 O
patients O
belonging O
to O
a O
cluster O
could O
an O
epidemiological O

be O
found. O
111 O
patients O
(19.6%) O
were O
identified O
as O
having O
had O
previous O
contact O
with O
a O
tuberculosis O
patient O
and O
81 O
of O
them O
(72.9%) O
belonged O
to O
a O
cluster. O
The O
three O
largest O
clusters O
included O
75, O
49 O
and O
20 O
patients, O
respectively. O
CONCLUSION: O
Recent O
transmission O
is O
frequent O
among O
patients O
with O
tuberculosis O
on O
Gran O
Canaria O
and O
could O
be O
associated O
with O
certain O
aspects O

Some O
of O

The O

In O

it O
was O

in O
Kurunegala O

Pacemaker O

The O

is O
a O
major O
determinant O
of O
diastolic O
depolarization O
in O
sinus O

and O
has O
a O

Therefore, O
we O
hypothesized O
that O
some O
forms O
of O
"idiopathic" O
sinus O

(SND) O
are O
related O

of O
the O
human O
HCN4 O

detected O
in O
a O
patient O
with O
idiopathic O
SND. O
The O

the O

cDNA O
indicated O
normal O
intracellular O

integration O
of O
HCN4-573X O

Patch-clamp O
experiments O
showed O
that O
HCN4-573X O
channels O
mediated O
I(f)-like O
currents O
that O
were O
insensitive O
to O
increased O

Coexpression O
experiments O
showed O
a O
dominant-negative O
effect O
of O
HCN4-573X O

These O

indicate O
that O

Taken O

the O

provide O
a O

METHODS: O
Two O

RESULT: O
Both O

Electrophysiologically, O
we O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
clinical O
and O

study O
of O
a O

the O
G/C B-MUT
polymorphism O
in O
the O
5'-untranslated O

The O
breast O

BRCA2 O
interact O
with O
RAD51, O
a O
protein O
essential O
for O

by O
playing O
a O
central O
role O
in O
homology-dependent O

of O
the O

Therefore, O
genetic O
variability O
in O
the O
RAD51 O

may O
contribute O
to O
the O
appearance O

progression O
of O
breast O

A O

in O
the O

(a O
G B-MUT
to O
C I-MUT
substitution O
at O
position O
135, O
the O
G/C B-MUT
polymorphism) O
is O
reported O
to O
modulate O
breast O

risk. O
We O
investigated O
the O
distribution O
of O
genotypes O
and O
frequency O
of O
alleles O
of O
the O
G/C B-MUT
polymorphism O
in O
breast O
cancer. O
Tumor O

were O
obtained O
from O
postmenopausal O
women O
with O
node-negative O
and O
node-positive O
breast O
carcinoma O
with O
uniform O
tumor O
size. O
Blood O
samples O
from O

matched O
healthy O
women O
served O
as O
control. O
The O
G/C B-MUT
polymorphism O
was O
determined O
by O
PCR-based O
MvaI O
restriction O
fragment O
length O
polymorphism. O
The O
distribution O
of O
the O
genotypes O
of O
the O
G/C B-MUT
polymorphism O
did O
not O
differ O
significantly O
(P O
> O
0.05) O
from O
those O
predicted O
by O
the O
Hardy-Weinberg O
distribution. O
There O
were O
no O
differences O
in O
the O
genotype O
distribution O
and O
allele O
frequencies O
between O
node-positive O
and O
node-negative O
patients. O
There O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
between O
distributions O
of O
the O
genotypes O
in O
subgroups O
assigned O
to O
histological O
grades O
according O
to O
Scarf-Bloom-Richardson O
criteria O
and O
the O
distribution O
predicted O
by O
Hardy-Weinberg O
equilibrium O
(P O
> O
0.05). O
Our O
study O
implies O
that O
the O
G/C B-MUT
polymorphism O
of O
the O
RAD51 O
gene O
may O
not O
be O
directly O
involved O
in O
the O
development O

progression O
of O
breast O

and O
so O
it O
may O
not O
be O
useful O
as O
an O

These O

We O
also O

in O
a O

Intragenic O
