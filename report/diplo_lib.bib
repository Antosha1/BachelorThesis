  annote    = {Generate cryptographic keys from images of fingerprints. Unclear how secure the scheme really is. Their security argument is based on one-time pads which is true for one part of their bioscrypt. However, they do not analysis whether the other part of the bioscrypt, the lookup table, does not leak information. (See \cite{DaFrMa98} for a paper doing more in that direction ...) Seems to be techniques as previously published in Proceedings of SPIE 3314, 178--188 and 3386, 24--35 (1998). Probably derived from Soutar and Tomko's 1996 Cardtech/Securetech paper?},

		 verification method in Web based electronic commerce.
		 Due to its simplicity, however, it is vulnerable to
		 imposter attacks. Keystroke dynamics and password
		 checking can be combined to result in a more secure
		 verification system. We propose an autoassociator
		 neural network that is trained with the timing vectors
		 of the owner's keystroke dynamics and then used to
		 discriminate between the owner and an imposter. An
		 imposter typing the correct password can be detected
		 with very high accuracy using the proposed approach.
		 This approach can be effectively implemented by a Java
		 applet and used for the Web.",
